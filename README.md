## Check before submit 🔎


If you are changing sidebar or adding media-files, please check that your submission will not break production 😱. You can do this by running a local instance of documentation:

1. Download repository from GitHub
2. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run local build
3. Open Terminal in project directory
4. Install dependencies with command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
5. Run project with command:

    ```
    npm run start
    ```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
