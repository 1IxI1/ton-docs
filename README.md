## Check before submit 🔎


If you are changing sidebar or adding mediafiles, please check that your submission will not break production 😱. You can do this in two ways:

### Cloud ☁️

You can use Gitpod (a free, online, VS code-like IDE) for contributing. It will launch a workspace with a single click:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs)

### Local 💻

1. Download repository from GitHub
2. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run local build
3. Open Terminal in project directory
4. Install dependencies with command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
5. Run project with command:

    ```
    npm run start
    ```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
