# How to Contribute

## Identify an area to Contribute to

There are several ways to identify an area where you can contribute to the Wiki:

- The easiest is to reach out to one of the [Docs maintainers](/docs/contribute/maintainers)
  saying "I want to help contribute to the TON Docs". They’ll work with you to find
  an area for you to contribute.
- If you have a specific contribution in mind but are unsure about it, confirm whether
  the contribution is appropriate by contacting one of the [Docs maintainers](/docs/contribute/maintainers) directly.
- See questions that often asked in TON Developers Chats.
- Feel free to read the issues in the GitHub repository.

## TL;DR

- If you need to add or change anything in TON Docs  raise a PR
  against the `main` branch.
- The documentation team will review the PR or reach out accordingly.
- Repository: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/docs

## Development

### Online one-click setup for contributing

You can use Gitpod (a free, online, VS Code-like IDE) for contributing. With a single click, it will launch a workspace and automatically:

* clone the docusaurus repo.
* install the dependencies.
* run `yarn start`
* So that you can start contributing straight away.

If you are adding a new document, it is recommended to just have a basic summary/introduction and a link to your github or documentation for more details.

### Code Conventions

- **Most important**: Look around. Match the style you see used in the rest of the project. This includes formatting, naming files, naming things in code, naming things in documentation, etc.
- "Attractive"
- **For documentation**: Do not wrap lines at 80 characters - configure your editor to soft-wrap when editing documentation.

Don't worry too much about styles in general—the maintainers will help you fix them as they review your code.



### Pull Requests

So you have decided to contribute code back to upstream by opening a pull request. You've invested a good chunk of time, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the PR looked at.

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

1. **Keep your PR small**. Small pull requests (~300 lines of diff) are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.
2. **Use descriptive titles**. It is recommended to follow commit message style.
3. **Test your changes**. Describe your test plan in your pull request description.

All pull requests should be opened against the `main` branch.

## What Happens Next?

The TON Docs team will be monitoring for pull requests. Do help us by keeping pull requests consistent by following the guidelines above.
