It is crucial to maintain consistency in documentation. To achieve this, a specific standard for visualizing processes in smart contracts has been developed.

## Graphic Explanation Notation

### Message Processing Graph
For representing message processing, it is recommended to use graphical notation in the form of a smart contract graph with transaction and message labels.
In cases where transaction explanations are not required on the diagram, their labels may be omitted for easier readability of message and contract details.

#### Annotation Primitives

|Figure|Description|Graphic|
|------|-----------|-------|
|Circle| Smart Contract entity | Circle.png |
|Parallelogram | Message Entity | Parallelogram.png |
|Parallelogram Dashed | Optional Message Entity | Parallelogram.png |
|Arrowed lines | Transactions (separate or united) | Arrows |

#### Example

### Sequence Diagram
In the case of complex and repetitive communication schemes between 2-3 actors, it is advisable to use a sequence diagram. For messages, use the notation of a common synchronous message arrow.

#### Example

### Recommended Format

* Place schemes in SVG format for better reading from various devices.
* Keep original files in the project git /static directory, for better modify in the future (/static/schemes-visio)
