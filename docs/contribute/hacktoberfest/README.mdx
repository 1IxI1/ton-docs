[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of *open-source projects*, their *maintainers*, and the entire community of *contributors*. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests.

## How to Participate?

Main concepts of the Hacktoberfest event are:

* **Hacktoberfest is open to everyone**!
* Four quality Pull Requests must be submitted to public GitHub/GitLab repositories.
* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

For everyone in TON it's an opportunity to drive the whole ecosystem growth and receive cool rewards from TON Foundation. Let's do it together!
