[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of *open-source projects*, their *maintainers*, and the entire community of *contributors*. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests.

For the TON community it's time to help ecosystem growth together, so let join to the whole world with our **Hack-TON-berfest** slug and become *#1 open-source ecosystem of the year*!

## How to Participate?

Rules of the Hacktoberfest event in 2022 are:

* **Hacktoberfest is open to everyone**!
* Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
* Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB project:
