Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests on GitHub.

Here are main concepts of the Hacktoberfest event:

* **Hacktoberfest is open to everyone**.
* Four quality Pull Requests must be submitted to public GitHub/GitLab repositories.
* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.
