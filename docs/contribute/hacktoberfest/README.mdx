[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of *open-source projects*, their *maintainers*, and the entire community of *contributors*. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests.

For the TON community it's time to help ecosystem growth together, so let join to the whole world with our **Hack-TON-berfest** slug and become *#1 open-source ecosystem of the year*!

## How to Participate?

Main concepts of the Hacktoberfest event are:

* **Hacktoberfest is open to everyone**!
* Four quality Pull Requests must be submitted to public GitHub/GitLab repositories.
* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

For everyone in TON it's an opportunity to drive the whole ecosystem growth and receive cool rewards from TON Foundation. Let's do it together!
