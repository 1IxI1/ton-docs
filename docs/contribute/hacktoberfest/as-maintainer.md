# Participate as Maintainer

Hacktoberfest event is the best time of year to receive support from the community!

If your repository is related to the TON ecosystem, you will have attention from many contributors. Let's help them dive properly into your project!

## Prepare to party

To handle contributors in a right way you need to have a repository in a good standing.
