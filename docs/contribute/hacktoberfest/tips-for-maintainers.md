# Participating as a Maintainer

## Prepare to party

To handle contributors in a right way you need to have a repository in a good standing.

Please, read and use [essential tips for new open-source maintainers](https://society.ton.org/essential-tips-for-new-open-source-maintainers) by TON Society.

After that feel free to add your repository to list.

## How to be listed and participate?

Help future contributors know more about your repository:
   1. Which category are the best suits for you?
   2. Who is a maintainer to communicate?
   3. Do you have an issues with reward in TON?

After that write directly to [one of maintainers](/contribute/maintainers) of the documentation.
