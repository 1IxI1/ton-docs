# USDT Processing

## Tether

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as a fiat currency or gold, to maintain a stable price. Such as [Tether](https://tether.to/en/) tokens which are assets that move across the blockchain just as easily as other digital currencies but that are pegged to real-world currencies on a 1-to-1 basis (e.g., 1 USD₮ = 1 USD) and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves. This offers traders, merchants and funds a low volatility solution when exiting positions in the market.

In TON Blockchain USD₮ supported as [Jetton](/develop/dapps/asset-processing/jettons).
