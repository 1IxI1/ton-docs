### Bird's eye view

**Apps** built on TON provide rich functionality and high performance and are designed to protect user funds via smart contracts. Because apps are built using decentralized technologies such as Blockchain, they are typically called decentralized applications (dApps).

**Wallets** provide the UI to approving transactions and hold users’ cryptographic keys securely on their personal devices. This separation of concerns enables rapid innovation and high level of security for the users: wallets do not need to build walled-garden ecosystems themselves, while the apps do not need to take the risk holding end users’ accounts.

TON Connect aims to offer a seamless user experience between wallets and apps.

## Integrate Tokens

You can create your own token on TON Blockchain and integrate it into your app. You can also integrate existing tokens into your app.

## Subscriptions on TON

Due to the fact that transactions in TON Blockchain are fast and the network fees are low, you can process recurring payments on-chain via smart contracts.

For example, users can subscribe to digital content (or anything else) and be charged a monthly fee of 1 TON.

### TON Payments

TON Payments is the platform for micropayment channels. It allows instant payments without the need to commit all transactions to the blockchain, pay the associated transaction fees (e.g., for the gas consumed), and wait five seconds until the block containing the transactions in question is confirmed.

Because the overall expense of such instant payments is so minimal, they can be used for micropayments in games, APIs, and off-chain apps. [See examples](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/defi/ton-payments#examples).

You create a bot that offers goods and services to Telegram users. Merchant bots can send specially formatted invoice messages to users, groups or channels. If your bot supports inline mode, users can also send invoices to other chats via the bot, including to one-on-one chats with other users.

Invoice messages feature a photo and description of the product along with a prominent Pay button. Tapping this button opens a special payment interface in the Telegram app. In this interface, users can choose a tip amount (if allowed by the merchant) and enter additional details like shipping info, phone number, or email address.

The bot can offer several shipping options for physical goods based on the delivery address. When ready, users enter their credit card info or choose a saved card — and pay for the product. Telegram also supports Apple Pay and Google Pay. Once the transaction is done, the merchant bot can send a receipt message with payment details, shipping and delivery information.
