# Testing Web Apps

## Using bots in the test environment

To log in to the test environment, use either of the following:

- **iOS:** tap 10 times on the Settings icon > Accounts > Login to another account > Test.
- **Telegram Desktop:** open ☰ Settings > Shift + Alt + Right click ‘Add Account’ and select ‘Test Server’.
- **macOS:** click the Settings icon 10 times to open the Debug Menu, ⌘ + click ‘Add Account’ and log in via phone number.

The test environment is completely separate from the main environment, so you will need to create a **new user account** and a **new bot** with @BotFather.

After receiving your bot token, you can send requests to the Bot API in this format:

`https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/test/METHOD_NAME`

**Note:** When working with the test environment, you may use HTTP links without TLS to test your Web App.

## Debug Mode for Web Apps

Use these tools to find app-specific issues in your Web App:

### Android

- [Enable USB-Debugging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/) on your device.
- In Telegram Settings, scroll all the way down, press and hold on the **version number** two times.
- Choose *Enable WebView Debug* in the Debug Settings.
- Connect your phone to your computer and open chrome://inspect/#devices in Chrome – you will see your Web App there when you launch it on your phone.

### Telegram Desktop on Windows and Linux

- Download and launch the [Beta Version](https://desktop.telegram.org/changelog#beta-version) of Telegram Desktop on **Windows** or **Linux** (not supported on Telegram Desktop for macOS yet).

- Right click in the WebView and choose *Inspect*.

### Telegram macOS
