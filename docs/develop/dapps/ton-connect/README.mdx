# How TON Connect works

TON Connect is a communication protocol between **wallets** and **apps** in TON.

**Apps** built on TON provide rich functionality and high performance and are designed to protect user funds via smart contracts. Because apps are built using decentralized technologies such as Blockchain, they are typically called decentralized applications (dApps).

**Wallets** provide the UI to approving transactions and hold users’ cryptographic keys securely on their personal devices.
This separation of concerns enables rapid innovation and high level of security for the users: wallets do not need to build walled-garden ecosystems themselves, while the apps do not need to take the risk holding end users’ accounts.

TON Connect aims to offer a seamless user experience between wallets and apps.
