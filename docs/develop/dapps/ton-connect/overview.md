## Connect with TON Ecosystem
For connecting your service with TON Ecosystem you need to support following:

- Create specified transaction message with TON libraries. Read about sending messages [here](/develop/smart-contracts/messages).
- Support TON Connect protocol in the application. Learn how to support TON Connect in [this](/develop/dapps/ton-connect) section of our documentation.
- Process payments through public API([tonapi](https://tonapi.io/)) or own indexer(for e.g. [gobycicle](http://github.com/gobicycle/bicycle)). Learn more in [this](/develop/dapps/asset-processing) section of our documentation.

Note, that not all Apps require payment processing. This means, if the business logic of your service will not require it, you will not have to support this.
