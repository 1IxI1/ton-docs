# Signing and Verification

## Use Cases

Please note that signing is not required for all DApps. It will be useful if you want to verify a user to provide them with their personal information from the back end. This is necessary for authorization on the backend, to prove that the user truly owned the declared address.


## How ton_proof Works?

- Send DAppid to client. Typically, DAppid nested in the QR code.
- Retrieve signed transaction with ton_proof entity
- Verify ton_proof on the backend side

## Structure of ton_proof

ton_proof works in TON Connect with a special `TonProof` entity, which implemented inside connector.

```js
type TonProofItemReply = TonProofItemReplySuccess | TonProofItemReplyError;

type TonProofItemReplySuccess = {
  name: "ton_proof";
  proof: {
    timestamp: string; // 64-bit unix epoch time of the signing operation (seconds)
    domain: {
      lengthBytes: number; // AppDomain Length
      value: string;  // app domain name (as url part, without encoding)
    };
    signature: string; // base64-encoded signature
    payload: string; // payload from the request
  }
}

```

## Check ton_proof with API

1. Retrieve `TonProofItemReply` from user.
2. Try to obtain public key via get_public_key get method on smart contract deployed at `address`
3. If the smart contract has not been deployed (e.g., the user has just created a new wallet locally in the wallet app) or does not support get_public_key method(v3 contracts), follow these steps:
* a. Parse wallet's StateInit `walletStateInit = TonAddressItemReply.walletStateInit`
* b. Retrieve `{public_key, address}` from `walletStateInit` with [TON API](https://tonapi.io/) method POST /v2/tonconnect/stateinit
*  Check that `address` extracted from `walletStateInit` or  corresponds to wallet's `address` declared by user.
4. Verify timestamp, domain, signature with `public_key` (examples [GO](https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-backend/blob/master/proof.go), [TS](https://gist.github.com/TrueCarry/cac00bfae051f7028085aa018c2a05c6), [Python](https://github.com/XaBbl4/pytonconnect/blob/main/examples/check_proof.py))

## How to Check TON Proof on Server Side

Obtain from the frontend the following data: wallet address, domain, timestamp, walletStateInit, signature

* Verify that the domain corresponds to the domain of your application
* Check that this payload was issued recently (you can issue cookies with the payload before authorization, and when checking ton_proof, verify the presence of a cookie for this client)
* Assemble a message according to the scheme from the previous slide
* Obtain the wallet's pubkey via the wallet contract's get method
* If the contract is not active, then obtaining the key in this manner will be impossible; you will need to parse the walletStateInit, which is provided by the frontend
* Verify that the signature from the frontend actually signs the assembled message and corresponds to the public key of the address

## React Example

1. Add token provider to the root of your app:

```tsx
function App() {
    const [token, setToken] = useState<string | null>(null);

  return (
      <BackendTokenContext.Provider value={{token, setToken}}>
            { /* Your app */ }
      </BackendTokenContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

2. Describe authentication for backend:

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```tsx
import {useContext, useEffect, useRef} from "react";
import {BackendTokenContext} from "./BackendTokenContext";
import {useIsConnectionRestored, useTonConnectUI, useTonWallet} from "@tonconnect/ui-react";
import {backendAuth} from "./backend-auth";

const localStorageKey = 'my-dapp-auth-token';
const payloadTTLMS = 1000 * 60 * 20;

export function useBackendAuth() {
    const { setToken } = useContext(BackendTokenContext);
    const isConnectionRestored = useIsConnectionRestored();
    const wallet = useTonWallet();
    const [tonConnectUI] = useTonConnectUI();
    const interval = useRef<ReturnType<typeof setInterval> | undefined>();

    useEffect(() => {
        if (!isConnectionRestored || !setToken) {
            return;
        }

        clearInterval(interval.current);

        if (!wallet) {
            localStorage.removeItem(localStorageKey);
            setToken(null);

            const refreshPayload = async () => {
                tonConnectUI.setConnectRequestParameters({ state: 'loading' });

                const value = await backendAuth.generatePayload();
                if (!value) {
                    tonConnectUI.setConnectRequestParameters(null);
                } else {
                    tonConnectUI.setConnectRequestParameters({state: 'ready', value});
                }
            }

            refreshPayload();
            setInterval(refreshPayload, payloadTTLMS);
            return;
        }

        const token = localStorage.getItem(localStorageKey);
        if (token) {
            setToken(token);
            return;
        }

        if (wallet.connectItems?.tonProof && !('error' in wallet.connectItems.tonProof)) {
            backendAuth.checkProof(wallet.connectItems.tonProof.proof, wallet.account).then(result => {
                if (result) {
                    setToken(result);
                    localStorage.setItem(localStorageKey, result);
                } else {
                    alert('Please try another wallet');
                    tonConnectUI.disconnect();
                }
            })
        } else {
            alert('Please try another wallet');
            tonConnectUI.disconnect();
        }

    }, [wallet, isConnectionRestored, setToken])
}
```

## Concept Explanation

If `TonProofItem` is requested, wallet proves ownership of the selected account’s key. The signed message is bound to:

- Unique prefix to separate messages from on-chain messages. (`ton-connect`)
- Wallet address
- App domain
- Signing timestamp
- App’s custom payload (where server may put its nonce, cookie id, expiration time)

```
message = utf8_encode("ton-proof-item-v2/") ++
          Address ++
          AppDomain ++
          Timestamp ++
          Payload

signature = Ed25519Sign(privkey, sha256(0xffff ++ utf8_encode("ton-connect") ++ sha256(message)))
```

where:

* `Address` is the wallet address encoded as a sequence:
 * `workchain`: 32-bit signed integer big endian;
 * `hash`: 256-bit unsigned integer big endian;
* `AppDomain` is Length ++ EncodedDomainName
- `Length` is 32-bit value of utf-8 encoded app domain name length in bytes
- `EncodedDomainName` id `Length`-byte  utf-8 encoded app domain name
* `Timestamp` 64-bit unix epoch time of the signing operation
* `Payload` is a variable-length binary string.

Note: payload is variable-length untrusted data. To avoid using unnecessary length prefixes we put it last in the message.

The signature must be verified by public key:

1. First, try to obtain public key via `get_public_key` get-method on smart contract deployed at `Address`.

2. If the smart contract is not deployed yet, or the get-method is missing, you need:

    1.  Parse `TonAddressItemReply.walletStateInit` and get public key from stateInit. You can compare the `walletStateInit.code` with the code of standard wallets contracts and parse the data according to the found wallet version.

    2.  Check that `TonAddressItemReply.publicKey` equals to obtained public key

    3.  Check that `TonAddressItemReply.walletStateInit.hash()` equals to `TonAddressItemReply.address`. `.hash()` means BoC hash.
