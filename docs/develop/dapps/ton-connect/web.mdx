# TON Connect for Websites


## Installation React

1. Install @tonconnect/ui-react in the project of your website:

```bash
npm i @tonconnect/ui-react
```

2. [Define manifest.json](#application-manifest) for you application.

3. Add `TonConnectUIProvider` to the root of the your website:

```tsx
import { TonConnectUIProvider } from '@tonconnect/ui-react';

export function App() {
    return (
        <TonConnectUIProvider manifestUrl="https://<YOUR_APP_URL>/tonconnect-manifest.json">
            { /* Your app */ }
        </TonConnectUIProvider>
    );
}
```

4. Add TonConnect Button
TonConnect Button is universal UI component for initializing connection. After wallet is connected it transforms to a wallet menu. It is recommended to place it in the top right corner of your app.

```tsx
export const Header = () => {
    return (
        <header>
            <span>My App with React UI</span>
            <TonConnectButton />
        </header>
    );
};
```
You can add className and style props to the button as well. Note that you cannot pass child to the TonConnectButton. <TonConnectButton className="my-button-class" style={{ float: "right" }}/>

## Installation JavaScript/HTML

```html
<script src="https://unkpg.com/@tonconnect/ui@0.09/dist/tonconnect-ui.min.js"></script>
```

:::tip

:::

2. [Define manifest.json](#application-manifest) for you application.

3. Create anchor in top right corner for the connection button
```html
<div id = "ton-connect" style="position: absolute; top: 2%; right: 2%"></div>
```

4. Final step, add script for a connector `tonConnectUI` in `<body>` part of application page:

```html
<script>
    const tonConnectUI = new TON_CONNECT_UI.TonConnectUI({
        manifestUrl: 'https://<YOUR_APP_URL>/tonconnect-manifest.json',
        buttonRootId: '<YOUR_CONNECT_BUTTON_ANCHOR_ID>'
    });
</script>
```


## Application manifest
App needs to have its manifest to pass meta information to the wallet. Manifest is a JSON file named as `tonconnect-manifest.json` following format:

```json
{
    "url": "<app-url>",                        // required
    "name": "<app-name>",                      // required
    "iconUrl": "<app-icon-url>",               // required
    "termsOfUseUrl": "<terms-of-use-url>",     // optional
    "privacyPolicyUrl": "<privacy-policy-url>" // optional
}
```

Example:

```json
{
    "url": "https://ton.vote",
    "name": "TON Vote",
    "iconUrl": "https://ton.vote/logo.png"
}
```

Best practice is to place the manifest in the root of your app, e.g. `https://myapp.com/tonconnect-manifest.json`. It allows the wallet to handle your app better and improve the UX connected to your app.
Make sure that manifest is available to GET by its URL.
