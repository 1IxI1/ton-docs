# Overview

TON Connect is a communication protocol between **wallets** and **apps** in the TON ecosystem.

**Apps** in TON provide rich functionality and high performance, while protecting users’ funds via smart contracts. Therefore they are often called decentralized apps or “dapps”.

**Wallets** provide the UI to approving transactions and hold users’ cryptographic keys securely on their personal devices.
This separation of concerns enables rapid innovation and high level of security for the users: wallets do not need to build walled-garden ecosystems themselves, while the apps do not need to take the risk holding end users’ accounts. TON Connect aims of offering a seamless user experience between the wallets and the apps.

In this documentation you will find main steps to implement TON Connect in your application.
