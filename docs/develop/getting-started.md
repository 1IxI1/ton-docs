## How TON works

TON is a fully decentralized layer-1 blockchain designed by Telegram to onboard billions of users. It boasts ultra-fast transactions, tiny fees, easy-to-use apps, and is environmentally friendly.


You can learn more about general architecture in [Basic Concepts](learn/overviews/TON_blockchain_overview.md) section.
