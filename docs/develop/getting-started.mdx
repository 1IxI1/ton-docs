# Quick Start

Depending on your use case and preference, you can develop online or using local env.

## Environment

### Online


You can try TON with TypeScript and FunC online on [Glitch Workspace](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/clone-from-repo?&REPO_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fton-defi-org%2Ftonstarter-contracts.git).

Glitch runs the [ton-standard-contracts](https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts) environment directly in the browser, so it is almost identical to the local setup but doesn't require installing anything on your machine.
