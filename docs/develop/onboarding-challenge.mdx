# Onboarding Challenge

Welcome aboard! üõ≥ Here you can become a true TVM Developer on the most advanced asynchronous blockchain in the world ‚Äî The Open Network (TON).

You will prove your talent using the most ancient and essential way in blockchains, starting from grandpa Bitcoin! As the first miners in TON, you will go through the Proof-of-Work smart contract and finally mine a secret reward for your TON wallet.

## ‚õè Mining on TON

The initial historical mining process on TON was finished a long time ago. After the TON Blockchain launch, POW Giver smart contract was launched, and everybody can participate. Fortunately, those times are over, and the era of Staking has begun.

Read more about mining history on TON.

But right now, you will finish the old ritual of becoming a true TVM Developer. Let's leave the boring Toncoins for old ones. Our goal for today will be to mine a secret NFT! This achievement will stay with you *forever*:

(visualize NFT here)

Here you can see all the developers who already mined their NFTs and became TVM Developer:

In the future, there will be a TOP with the most advanced developers on TON, and a completed onboarding challenge will give you some points to become #1 on TON.

## üìö Basic Concepts

Before start, it would be good for you to understand some concepts. Otherwise, you would be scary of the things we will cover later. We won't go deep in theory, but some points are necessary to understand:

## üì≤ Prepare a Wallet

As any miner years ago, you need a non-custodial wallet with your address to receive and store your future reward!

Moreover, you need a testnet mode enabled to collect some test Toncoins. You will use them to send a final minting transaction to the smart contract later.

So, prepare your wallet by these 2 steps:

1. Install a Tonkeeper app on your smart phone.
2. [Enable test mode in Tonkeeper](https://ton.org/docs/participate/wallets/apps#tonkeeper) to play with TON Testnet.

Easy! Let's go to development right now.

##  ü™Ñ Prepare a Miner

To make your life easier and omit routine low-level stuff, we will use a boilerplate. Please, use the [ton-onboarding-challenge](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge) template to create your project there:

After completing this step, you get a fully-fledged repository that can be used as your miner's core. Congratulations! ‚ú®

### Developer environment: cloud vs local

Before you go to environment setup, you should know: it's possible to complete TON Onboarding Challenge completely in the cloud!

If you don't use Javascript in your everyday life, you don't want to install Javascript IDE and tools, or your computer is not a good choice for development, it would be faster to use a **cloud environment**. It's completely free and provided by GitHub.

However, if you're familiar with NodeJS, and Git and know how to work with `npm`, it would be more comfortable for you to use a **local environment**.

#### Cloud codespace

Good, so you decided to use the cloud today! In 2022 it's easy to start any project in the cloud with one simple step on your GitHub repository:

After this, GitHub will create a special cloud workspace with VSCode Online IDE. You don't need to install git, nodejs, or other tools.

Just wait for ~30 seconds so that the terminal will install all dependencies.

#### Local environment

For local development you need 3 things:

- **Git**. Essential tool for every developer. Download it here.
- **NodeJS**. We will use Javascript with TypeScript mode as the most popular choice for DApp development. Download it here.
- **Javascript IDE**. Use your normal choice.

To start development, please:

1. Clone your GitHub repository boilerplate
2. Open repository in your IDE

Great! After these steps you're ready to go deeper to the TON Blockchain secrets.
