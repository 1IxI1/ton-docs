# Onboarding Challenge

Welcome aboard! üõ≥ Today you will become a true **TVM Developer** on the most advanced asynchronous blockchain in the world called The Open Network (TON).

As the first miners on TON, you will go through the Proof-of-Work smart contract and finally mine a secret reward for your TON wallet. Look at that:

    <source src="/docs/files/onboarding-nft.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

Our goal for today is to mine an NFT! This achievement will stay with you *forever*.

Finally, you can mine this NFT achievement even in mainnet. (_it costs only 0,05 TON!_)

## ‚õè Mining on TON

Today you will prove your talent using the most ancient and essential way in blockchains, starting from grandpa Bitcoin! _~Mining~_

The initial historical mining process on TON was finished a long time ago. After the TON Blockchain launch, POW Giver smart contracts were launched, and everybody can participate. Fortunately, those times are over, and the era of Staking has begun.

But right now, you will finish the old ritual of becoming a true **TVM Developer**. Let's leave the boring Toncoins for old ones. Let's mine an NFT today! Here is what you will make:

<div style={{textAlign:'center', margin: '0 auto'}}>
  <video style={{borderRadius:'10pt', margin:'15pt auto', maxWidth: '90%'}} muted={true} autoPlay={true} loop={true}>
    <source src="/docs/files/onboarding.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

Amazed? It's possible to make miner in __2 hours__ from now, just stay in focus.

Let's go deeper into the Onboarding Challenge now.

## üìö Basic Concepts

Before start, it would be good for you to understand some concepts. Otherwise, you would be scary of the things we will cover later. We won't go deep in theory, but some points are necessary to understand:

## üì≤ Prepare a Wallet

As any miner years ago, you need a _non-custodial_ wallet with your address to receive and store your future reward! Moreover, you need a testnet mode enabled to collect some test Toncoins. You will use them to send a final minting transaction to the smart contract later.

So, prepare your wallet by these 2 steps:

1. Install a Tonkeeper app on your smart phone.
2. [Enable test mode in Tonkeeper](https://ton.org/docs/participate/wallets/apps#tonkeeper) to play with TON Testnet.

Easy! Let's go to development right now.

##  ü¶Ñ Project setup

To make your life easier and omit routine low-level stuff, we will use a boilerplate. Please, use the [ton-onboarding-challenge](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge) template to create your project there:

After completing this step, you get a fully-fledged repository that can be used as your miner's core. Congratulations! ‚ú®

### Development environment

Before we'll cover environment setup, you should know: _it's possible to complete TON Onboarding Challenge completely in the cloud! It's free and quickly._

#### Cloud vs Local

* If you don't use Javascript in your everyday life, you don't want to install Javascript IDE and tools, or your computer is not a good choice for development, it would be faster to use a **cloud environment**. It's completely free and provided by GitHub.

* However, if you're familiar with NodeJS, and Git and know how to work with `npm`, it would be more comfortable for you to use a **local environment**.

#### Cloud codespace

Good, so you decided to use the cloud today! In 2022 it's easy to start any project in the cloud with one simple step on your GitHub repository:

![[Pasted image 20221213215943.png]]

After this, GitHub will create a special cloud workspace with VSCode Online IDE. You don't need to install git, nodejs, or other tools.

Just wait for ~30 seconds so that the terminal will install all dependencies.

#### Local environment

For local development you need 3 things:

- **Git**. Essential tool for every developer. Download it here.
- **NodeJS**. We will use Javascript with TypeScript mode as the most popular choice for DApp development. Download it here.
- **Javascript IDE**. Use your normal choice.

To start development, please:

1. Clone your GitHub repository boilerplate
2. Open repository in your IDE

Great! After these steps you're ready to go deeper to the TON Blockchain secrets.
