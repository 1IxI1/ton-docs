# Introduction

Smart contract creation, development, and deployment on TON Blockchain leverages the FunC programming language and TON Virtual Machine (TVM). The section of our documentation will give software engineers an overview of smart contract development on TON and provide an overview of the various tooling systems and frameworks needed to ensure a seamless developer experience for all involved.

## Getting Started

TON Hello World guide is _the easiest way_ to start with smart contracts development:
* [TON Hello World: Step-by-step guide for writing your first smart contract](https://ton-community.github.io/tutorials/02-contract/)

### Community Tutorials

* [TON Learn FunC journey: 10 zero-to-hero lessons](https://blog.ton.org/func-journey) ([Ru version](https://github.com/romanovichim/TonFunClessons_ru))
* [Introduction to FunC: how to start developing on TON?](https://dev.to/dvlkv/introduction-in-func-how-to-start-developing-in-ton-50hp)

## Testing and Debugging

The easiest way to start testing your smart contract is:

## Environment

The installation process for Local Environments may require more knowledge and time, but they are better suited for everyday use and eliminate the need for internet dependency.
These include IDE plugins, various SDKs, binaries, syntax highlighting, and more. Check out [our local environment installation guide](/develop/smart-contracts/environment/installation) to learn more.

## Development Toolkit

Development toolkits play a pivotal role in the development of smart contracts on TON Blockchain. To begin developing, testing, and debugging smart contracts on TON, we’ll make use of these products and services:

### JavaScript SDK

* [Choose your desired JavaScript SDK](/develop/smart-contracts/sdk/javascript)

### Other Tools

* [disintar/toncli](/develop/smart-contracts/sdk/toncli) — The toncli is the command line interface used to build, deploy, and test FunC contracts.
* [MyLocalTON](/participate/nodes/local-ton) — MyLocalTON is used to run a private TON Blockchain in your local environment.
* [tonwhales.com/tools/boc](https://tonwhales.com/tools/boc) — BOC parser.
* [tonwhales.com/tools/introspection-id](https://tonwhales.com/tools/introspection-id) — crc32 generator.
* [@orbs-network/ton-access](https://www.orbs.com/ton-access/) — decentralized API gateway.

## TON Virtual Machine

TON smart contracts are executed on TON Virtual Machine (TVM).
The TVM is a stack-based virtual machine that employs many qualities that make it efficient and easy to implement.

To get a better understanding of how the TVM works, consider reading the [TVM Overview](/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview) section of our documentation. .

## FunC Programming Language

FunC is TON’s high-level programming language used to program smart contracts on TON Blockchain. The proprietary in-house language is a domain-specific statically typed framework which exhibits many characteristics simply not found in competing language types.

Feel free to read more about FunC in the [FunC Overview section](/develop/func/overview.md) of our documentation.

## Smart Contract Examples

:::info little tip
Feel free to focus on smart contracts written using _FunC_. it's often better to focus on smart contracts written using FunC (*.fc) instead of the lower-level Fift (*.fif) language.
:::

Standard examples of smart contracts on TON include wallets, electors (which manage validation on TON), multi-signature wallets can be a reference when studying.

If you're familiar with smart contracts, consider reading the following GitHub specifications for more context:

- [Fungible (Jettons), Non-Fungible (NFT), Semi-Fungible Tokens smart contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/tree/main)
- [Getgems NFT, sale, auctions smart contracts (FunC)](https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts)
- [Wallet V4 smart contract example](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract)
- [Standard smart contracts examples](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/smartcont)
- [Super Simple Chatbot: doge.fc](https://github.com/LaDoger/doge.fc)

Additionally, discover more [FunC libraries and SDK](/develop/smart-contracts/libraries) in the FunC section of our documentation.

## Smart Contract Guidelines

TON’s systemized smart contract development allows engineers to build smart contracts for many uses. That said, to unlock the full capabilities of smart contract iteration on TON, it's necessary to follow our predetermined smart contract guidelines to ensure their correct composition.
* [Smart contract guidelines](/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines)

## Fift language

:::caution advanced level
This information is **very low level** and may be challenging for newcomers to understand. Therefore, we suggest that you read about it later at your convenience.
:::

Messages to smart contracts are binary data. To construct such messages, you can use one of the SDKs **or** the special programming language Fift.

* [Fift Overview](/docs/develop/fift/overview)

## Tact language

:::caution advanced level
The Tact language is developed by independent developers. Use at your own risk.
