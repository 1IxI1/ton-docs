# Introduction

Smart contract creation, development, and deployment on TON Blockchain leverages the [FunC programming language](/develop/smart-contracts/#func-language) and [TON Virtual Machine (TVM)](/develop/smart-contracts/#ton-virtual-machine).

## Quick Start: Your First Smart Contract

Write and deploy your first smart contract with *Blueprint* framework.

Blueprint is a development environment for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
To create a new demo project use the following command:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

## Examples of Smart Contracts

Explore ready-made smart contract examples and tools provided by the TON community.

:::info little tip
Feel free to focus on smart contracts written using _FunC_. it's often better to focus on smart contracts written using FunC (*.fc) instead of the lower-level Fift (*.fif) language.
:::

Standard examples of smart contracts on TON include wallets, electors (which manage validation on TON), multi-signature wallets can be a reference when studying.
