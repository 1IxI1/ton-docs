# Writing Tests with Blueprint

## Testing Overview

Testing toolkit (usually, sandbox) already included to the TypeScript SDK named Blueprint. You can create demo project and launch default test with two steps:

1. Install Blueprint project
```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

2. Install Blueprint project
```bash
npx blueprint test
```

## Basic Usage
Testing of smart contracts allows for the coverage of security, optimization of gas spending, and examination of edge cases.
Writing tests in Blueprint (that based on Sandbox) works through defining arbitary actions with the contract and comparing their results with the expected result, for example:

```typescript
it('should execute with success', async () => {                              // description of the test case
    const res = await main.sendMessage(sender.getSender(), toNano('0.05'));  // performing an action with contract main and saving result in res

    expect(res.transactions).toHaveTransaction({                             // configure the expected result with expect() function
        from: main.address,                                                  // set expected sender for transaction we want to test matcher properties from
        success: true                                                        // set the desirable result using matcher property success
    });

    printTransactionFees(res.transactions);                                  // print table with details on spent fees
});
```


### Writing Tests for Different Properties

The basic workflow of creating a test is:
1. Create a specific wrapped `Contract` entity using `blockchain.openContract()`.
2. Describe the actions your `Contract` should perform and save the execution result in `res` variable.
3. Verify the properties using the `expect()` function and the matcher `toHaveTransaction()`.

The `toHaveTransaction` matcher expects an object with any combination of fields from the `FlatTransaction` type defined with the following properties

| Name                 | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                         |

You can omit those that you're not interested in, and you can also pass in functions accepting those types returning booleans (`true` meaning good) to check for example number ranges, message opcodes, etc. Note however that if a field is optional (like `from?: Address`), then the function needs to accept the optional type, too.
