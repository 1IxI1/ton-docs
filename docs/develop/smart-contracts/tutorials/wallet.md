# Working With Wallet Smart Contracts

## üëã Introduction

Learning how wallets and transactions work on TON before beginning smart contracts development is essential. This knowledge will help developers understand the interaction between wallets, transactions, and smart contracts to implement specific development tasks.

In this section we‚Äôll learn to create operations without using pre-configured functions to understand development workflows. All references necessary for the analysis of this tutorial are located in the references chapter.

## üí° Prerequisites

This tutorial requires basic knowledge of Javascript, Typescript, and Golang. It is also necessary to hold at least 3 TON tokens (which can be stored in a stock account, a non-custodial wallet, or by using the telegram bot wallet). It is necessary to have a basic understanding of [cell](/learn/overviews/cells), [addresses in TON](/learn/overviews/addresses), [blockchain of blockchains](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain) to understand this tutorial.

:::info MAINNET DEVELOPMENT IS ESSENTIAL   
Working with the TON Testnet often leads to deployment errors, difficulty tracking transactions, and unstable network functionality. Therefore, it could be beneficial to complete most development on the TON Mainnet to potentially avoid these issues, which might be necessary to reduce the number of transactions and thereby possibly minimize fees.

## Source Code
All code examples used in this tutorial can be found in the following [GitHub repository]((https://github.com/aSpite/wallet-tutorial)).


## ‚úçÔ∏è What You Need To Get Started

- Ensure NodeJS is installed.
- Specific Ton libraries are required and include: @ton/ton 13.4.1+, @ton/core 0.48.0+ and @ton/crypto 3.2.0+.

**OPTIONAL**: If you prefer to use GO instead JS, it is  necessary to install the [tonutils-go](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go) library and the GoLand IDE to conduct development on TON. This library will be used in this tutorial for the GO version.

## ‚öô Set Your Environment

In order to create a TypeScript project its necessary to conduct the following steps in order:
1. Create an empty folder (which we‚Äôll name WalletsTutorial).
2. Open the project folder using the CLI.
3. Use the followings commands to set up your project:
```bash
npm init -y
npm install typescript @types/node ts-node nodemon --save-dev
npx tsc --init --rootDir src --outDir build \ --esModuleInterop --target es2020 --resolveJsonModule --lib es6 \ --module commonjs --allowJs true --noImplicitAny false --allowSyntheticDefaultImports true --strict false
```
:::info
To help us carry out the next process a `ts-node` is used to execute TypeScript code directly without precompiling. `nodemon` is used to restart the node application automatically when file changes in the directory are detected.
:::
4. Next, remove these lines from `tsconfig.json`:
```json
  "files": [
    "\\",
    "\\"
  ]
```
5. Then, create a `nodemon.json` config in your project root with the following content:
```json
{
  "watch": ["src"],
  "ext": ".ts,.js",
  "ignore": [],
  "exec": "npx ts-node ./src/index.ts"
}
```
6. Add this script to `package.json` instead of "test", which is added when the project is created:
```json
"start:dev": "npx nodemon"
```
7. Create `src` folder in the project root and `index.ts` file in this folder.
8. Next, the following code should be added:
```ts
async function main() {
  console.log("Hello, TON!");
}

main().finally(() => console.log("Exiting..."));
```
9. Run the code using terminal:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
10. Finally, the console output will appear.

:::tip Blueprint
BLUEPRINT: The TON Community created an excellent tool for automating all development processes (deployment, contract writing, testing) called [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint). However, we will not be needing such a powerful tool, so it is suggested that the instructions above are followed.
:::

**OPTIONAL: ** When using Golang, follow these instructions::

1. Install the GoLand IDE.
2. Create a project folder and `go.mod` file using the following content (the **version of Go** may need to be changed to conduct this process if the current version being used it outdated):
```
module main

go 1.20
```
3. Type the following command into the terminal:
```bash
go get github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go
```
4. Create the `main.go` file in the root of your project with following content:
```go
package main

import (
	"log"
)

func main() {
	log.Println("Hello, TON!")
}

```
5. Change the name of the module in the `go.mod` to `main`.
6. Run the code above until the output in the terminal is displayed.

:::info
It is also possible to use another IDE since GoLand isn‚Äôt free, but it is preferred.
:::

:::warning IMPORTANT
All coding components should be added to the `main` function that was created in the [‚öô Set Your Environment](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet#-set-your-environment) section.

Additionally, only the imports required for a specific code section will be specified in each new section and new imports will need to be added and combined with old ones.

## üöÄ  Let's Get Started!

In this tutorial we‚Äôll learn which wallets (version‚Äôs 3 and 4) are most often used on TON Blockchain and get acquainted with how their smart contracts work. This will allow developers to better understand the different transaction types on the TON platform to make it simpler to create transactions, send them to the blockchain, deploy wallets, and eventually, be able to work with high-load wallets.

Our main task is to build transactions using various objects and functions for ton-core, ton, and ton-crypto (ExternalMessage, InternalMessage, Signing etc.) to understand what transactions look like on a bigger scale. To carry out this process we'll make use of two main wallet versions (v3 and v4) because of the fact that exchanges, non-custodial wallets, and most users only used these specific versions.

:::note
There may be occasions in this tutorial when there is no explanation for particular details. In these cases, more details will be provided in later stages of this tutorial.

**IMPORTANT:** Throughout this tutorial [wallet v3 code](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/wallet3-code.fc) is used to better understand the wallet development process. It should be noted that version v3 has two sub-versions: r1 and r2. Currently, only the second version is being used, this means that when we refer to v3 in this document it means v3r2.
:::

## üíé TON Blockchain Wallets

All wallets that operate and run on TON Blockchain are actually smart contracts, in the same way, everything operating on TON is a smart contract. Like most blockchains, it is possible to deploy smart contracts on the network and customize them for different uses. Thanks to this feature, **full wallet customization is possible**.
On TON wallet smart contracts help the platform communicate with other smart contract types. However, it is important to consider how wallet communication takes place.

### Wallet Communication
Generally, there are two transaction types on TON Blockchain: `internal` and `external`. External transactions allow for the ability to send messages to the blockchain from the outside world, thus allowing for the communication with smart contracts that accept such transactions. The function responsible for carrying out this process is as follows:

```func
() recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {
    ;; some code
}
```
Before we dive into more details concerning wallets, let‚Äôs look at how wallets accept external transactions. On TON, all wallets hold the owner‚Äôs `public key`, `seqno`, and `subwallet_id`. When receiving an external transaction, the wallet uses the `get_data()` method to retrieve data from the storage portion of the wallet. It then conducts several verification procedures and decides whether to accept the transaction or not. This process is conducted as follows:

```func
() recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {
  var signature = in_msg~load_bits(512); ;; get signature from the message body
  var cs = in_msg;
  var (subwallet_id, valid_until, msg_seqno) = (cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(32));  ;; get rest values from the message body
  throw_if(35, valid_until <= now()); ;; check the relevance of the transaction
  var ds = get_data().begin_parse(); ;; get data from storage and convert it into a slice to be able to read values
  var (stored_seqno, stored_subwallet, public_key) = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(256)); ;; read values from storage
  ds.end_parse(); ;; make sure we do not have anything in ds variable
  throw_unless(33, msg_seqno == stored_seqno);
  throw_unless(34, subwallet_id == stored_subwallet);
  throw_unless(35, check_signature(slice_hash(in_msg), signature, public_key));
  accept_message();
```

Now let‚Äôs take a closer look.

### Replay Protection - Seqno

Transaction replay protection in the wallet smart contract is directly related to the transaction seqno (Sequence Number) which keeps track of which transactions are sent in which order. It is very important that a single transaction is not repeated from a wallet because it throws off the integrity of the system entirely. If we further examine smart contract code within a wallet, the `seqno` is typically handled as follows:

```func
throw_unless(33, msg_seqno == stored_seqno);
```

This line of code above checks the `seqno`, which comes in the transaction and checks it with `seqno`, which is stored in a smart contract. The contract returns an error with `33 exit code` if they do not match. So if the sender passed invalid seqno, it means that he made some mistake in the transaction sequence, and the contract protects against such cases.

### Signature

As mentioned earlier, wallet smart contracts accept external transactions. However, these transactions come from the outside world and that data cannot be 100% trusted. Therefore, each wallet stores the owner's public key. The smart contract uses a public key to verify the legitimacy of the transaction signature when receiving an external transaction that the owner signed with the private key. This verifies that the transaction is actually from the (contract) owner.

To carry out this process, the wallet must first obtain the signature from the incoming message which loads the public key from storage and validates the signature using the following process:

```func
var signature = in_msg~load_bits(512);
var ds = get_data().begin_parse();
var (stored_seqno, stored_subwallet, public_key) = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(256));
throw_unless(35, check_signature(slice_hash(in_msg), signature, public_key));
```

And if all verification processes are completed correctly, the smart contract accepts the message and processes it:

```func
accept_message();
```

:::info accept_message()
Because the transaction comes from the outside world, it does not contain the Toncoin required to pay the transaction fee. When sending TON using the accept_message() function, a gas_credit (at the time of writing its value is 10,000 gas units) is applied which allows the necessary calculations to be carried out for free if the gas does not exceed the gas_credit value. After the accept_message() function is used, all the gas spent (in TON) is taken from the balance of the smart contract. More can be read about this process [here](/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/accept).
:::

### Transaction Expiration

Another step used to check the validity of external transactions is the `valid_until` field. As you can see from the variable name, this is the time in UNIX before the transaction is valid. If this verification process fails, the contract completes the processing of the transaction and returns the 32 exit code follows:

```func
var (subwallet_id, valid_until, msg_seqno) = (cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(32));
throw_if(35, valid_until <= now());
```

This algorithm works to protect against the susceptibility of various errors when the transaction is no longer valid but was still sent to the blockchain for an unknown reason.

### Wallet v3 and Wallet v4 Differences

The only difference between Wallet v3 and Wallet v4 is that Wallet v4 makes use of `plugins` that can be installed and deleted. These plugins are special smart contracts which are able to request a specific number of TON at a specific time from a wallet smart contract.

Wallet smart contracts, in turn, will send the required amount of TON in response without the need for the owner to participate. This is similar to the **subscription model** for which plugins are created. We will not learn these details, because this is out of the scope of this tutorial.

### How Wallets facilitate communication with Smart Contracts

As we discussed earlier, a wallet smart contract accepts external transactions, validates them and accepts them if all checks are passed. The contract then starts the loop of retrieving messages from the body of external messages then creates internal messages and sends them to the blockchain as follows:


```func
cs~touch();
while (cs.slice_refs()) {
    var mode = cs~load_uint(8); ;; load transaction mode
    send_raw_message(cs~load_ref(), mode); ;; get each new internal message as a cell with the help of load_ref() and send it
}
```

:::tip touch()
On TON, all smart contracts run on the stack-based TON Virtual Machine (TVM). ~ touch() places the variable cs on top of the stack to optimize the running of code for less gas.
:::

Since a **maximum of 4 references** can be stored in one cell it is necessary to send four transactions per external transaction.

## üì¨  External and Internal Transactions

In this section, we‚Äôll learn more about `internal` and `external` transactions and we‚Äôll create transactions and send them to the network to minimize the use of pre-cooked functions.

To carry out this process it is necessary to make use of a ready-made wallet to make the task easier. To accomplish this:
1. Install the [wallet app](/participate/wallets/apps)(e.g., Tonkeeper is used by the author)  
2. Switch wallet app to v3r2 address version
3. Deposit 1 TON into the wallet 
4. Send the transaction to another address (you can send to yourself, to the same wallet). 

This way, the Tonkeeper wallet app will deploy the wallet contract and we can use it for the following steps.

:::note
At the time of writing, most wallet apps on TON by default use the wallet v4 version. Plugins are not required and we‚Äôll make use of the functionality provided by wallet v3. During use, Tonkeeper allows the user to choose the version of the wallet they want. Therefore, it is recommended to deploy wallet version 3 (wallet v3).
:::

### TL-B

As noted, everything in TON Blockchain is a smart contracts consists of cells. To properly serialize and deserialize the data we need standards. To accomplish the serialization and deserialization process, `TL-B` was created as a universal tool to describe different data types in different ways with different sequences inside cells.

In this section, we‚Äôll examine [block.tlb](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/block/block.tlb). This file will be very useful during future development, as it describes how different cells should be assembled. In our case specifically, it details the intricacies of internal and external transactions.

:::info
Basic information will be provided within this guide. For further details, please refer to our TL-B [documentation](/develop/data-formats/tl-b-language) to learn more about TL-B.
:::

### CommonMsgInfo

Initially, each message must first store `CommonMsgInfo` ([TL-B](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L123-L130)) or `CommonMsgInfoRelaxed` ([TL-B](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L132-L137)). This allows us to define technical details that relate to the transaction type, transaction time, recipient address, technical flags, and fees.

By reading `block.tlb` file we can notice three types of CommonMsgInfo: `int_msg_info$0`, `ext_in_msg_info$10`, `ext_out_msg_info$11`. We will not go into specific details detailing the specificities of the `ext_out_msg_info` TL-B structure. That said, it is an external transaction type that a smart contract can send for using as external logs. For examples of this format, consider having a closer look at the [Elector]((https://tonscan.org/address/Ef8zMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzM0vF)) contract.


[Looking at TL-B](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L127-L128), you‚Äôll notice that **only the CommonMsgInfo is available when used with the ext_in_msg_info type**. This is because transaction type fields such as `src`, `created_lt`, `created_at`, and others are rewritten by validators during transaction handling. In this case, the `src` transaction type is most important because when transactions are sent, the sender is unknown, and is written by validators during verification. This ensures that the address in the `src` field is correct and cannot be manipulated.

However, the `CommonMsgInfo` structure only supports the `MsgAddress` specification, but the sender‚Äôs address is typically unknown and it is required to write the `addr_none` (two zero bits `00`). In this case, the `CommonMsgInfoRelaxed` structure is used, which supports the `addr_none` address. For the `ext_in_msg_info` (used primarily for incoming external messages), the `CommonMsgInfo` structure is used because these message types don‚Äôt make use of a sender and always use the [MsgAddressExt](https://hub.com/ton/ton.blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L100) structure (the `addr_none$00` meaning two zero bits), which means there is no need to overwrite the data.

:::note
The numbers after `$` symbol are the bits that are required to store at the beginning of a certain structure, for further identification of these structures during reading (deserialization).
:::

### Internal Transaction Creation

Internal transactions are used to send messages between contracts. When analyzing various contract types (such as NFT‚Äôs and, Jettons) that send messages where the writing of contracts is considered, the following lines of code are often used:

When analyzing various contract types (such as [NFTs](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/f2253cb0f0e1ae0974d7dc0cef3a62cb6e19f806/nft/nft-item.fc#L51-L56) and, [Jetons](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/f2253cb0f0e1ae0974d7dc0cef3a62cb6e19f806/ft/jetton-wallet.fc#L139-L144)) that send messages where the writing of contracts is considered, the following lines of code are often used:

```func
var msg = begin_cell()
  .store_uint(0x18, 6) ;; or 0x10 for non-bounce
  .store_slice(to_address)
  .store_coins(amount)
  .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)
  ;; store something as a body
```

Let‚Äôs first consider `0x18` and `0x10` (x - hexadecimal), which are hexadecimal numbers laid out in the following manner (given that we allocate 6 bits): `011000` and `010000`. This means that the code above can be overwritten as follows:

```func
var msg = begin_cell()
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; this bit indicates that we send an internal message according to int_msg_info$0  
  .store_uint(1, 1) ;; IHR Disabled
  .store_uint(1, 1) ;; or .store_uint(0, 1) for 0x10 | bounce
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; bounced
  .store_uint(0, 2) ;; src -> two zero bits for addr_none
  .store_slice(to_address)
  .store_coins(amount)
  .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)
  ;; store something as a body
```
Now let‚Äôs go through each option in detail:

Option | Explanation
:---: | :---:
IHR Disabled | Currently, this option is disabled (which means we store 1) because Instant Hypercube Routing is not fully implemented. In addition, this will be needed when a large number of [Shardchains](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain#many-accountchains-shards) are live on the network. More can be read about the IHR Disabled option in the [tblkch.pdf](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf) (chapter 2).
Bounce | While sending transactions, a variety of errors can occur during smart contract processing. To avoid losing TON, it is necessary to set the Bounce option to 1 (true). In this case, if any contract errors occur during transaction processing, the transaction will be returned to the sender, and the same amount of TON will be received minus fees. More can be read about non-bounceable messages [here](/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/non-bouncable-messages).
Bounced | Bounced transactions are transactions that are returned to the sender because an error occurred while processing the transaction with a smart contract. This option tells you whether the transaction received is bounced or not.
Src | The Src is the sender address. In this case, two zero bits are written to indicate the `addr_none` address.

The next two lines of code:
```func
...
.store_slice(to_address)
.store_coins(amount)
...
```
- we specify the recipient and the number of TON to be sent.

Finally, let‚Äôs look at the remaining lines of code:

```func
...
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; Extra currency
  .store_uint(0, 4) ;; IHR fee
  .store_uint(0, 4) ;; Forwarding fee
  .store_uint(0, 64) ;; Logical time of creation
  .store_uint(0, 32) ;; UNIX time of creation
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; State Init
  .store_uint(0, 1) ;; Message body
  ;; store something as a body
```
Option | Explanation
:---: | :---:
Extra currency | This is a native implementation of existing tokens and is not currently in use.
IHR fee | As mentioned, the IHR is not currently in use, so this fee is always zero. More can be read about this in the [tblkch.pdf](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf) (3.1.8).
Forwarding fee | A forwarding message fee. More can be read about this in the [fees documentation](/develop/howto/fees-low-level#transactions-and-phases).
Logical time of creation | The time used to create the correct transaction queue. 
UNIX tome of creation | The time the transaction was created in UNIX.
State Init | Code and source data for deploying a smart contract. If the bit is set to `0`, it means that we do not have a State Init. But if it is set to `1`, then another bit needs to be written which indicates whether the State Init is stored in the same cell (0) or written as a reference (1).
Message body | This part defines how the message body is stored. At times the message body is too large to fit into the message itself. In this case, it should be stored as a **reference** whereby the bit is set to `1` to show that the body is used as a reference. If the bit is `0`, the body is in the same cell as the message.

The values outlined above (including src) excluding the State Init and the Message Body bits, are rewritten by validators.

:::note
If the number value fits within fewer bits than is specified, then the missing zeros are added to the left side of the value. For example, if 0x18 fits within 5 bits -> `11000`. However, since 6 bits were specified, the end result becomes `011000`.
:::

Next, we‚Äôll begin preparing a transaction, which will be sent Toncoins to another wallet v3.
First, let‚Äôs say a user wants to send 0.5 TON to themselves with the text "**Hello, TON!**", refer to this section of our documentation to learn ([How to send message with a comment](/develop/func/cookbook#how-to-send-a-simple-message)).

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { beginCell } from "ton";

let internalMessageBody = beginCell().
  storeUint(0, 32). // write 32 zero bits to indicate that a text comment will follow
  storeStringTail("Hello, TON!"). // write our text comment
  endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
	"github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tvm/cell"
)

internalMessageBody := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0, 32). // write 32 zero bits to indicate that a text comment will follow
  MustStoreStringSnake("Hello, TON!"). // write our text comment
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Above we created an `InternalMessageBody` in which the body of our message is stored. Note that when storing text that does not fit into a single Cell (1023 bits), it is necessary **to split the data into several cells** according to [the following documentation](/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/internal-messages). However, in this case the high-level libraries creates cells according to requirements, so at this stage there is no need to worry about it.

Next, the `InternalMessage` is created according to the information we have studied earlier as follows:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { toNano, Address } from "ton";

const walletAddress = Address.parse('put your wallet address');

let internalMessage = beginCell().
  storeUint(0, 1). // indicate that it is an internal message -> int_msg_info$0
  storeBit(1). // IHR Disabled
  storeBit(1). // bounce
  storeBit(0). // bounced
  storeUint(0, 2). // src -> addr_none
  storeAddress(walletAddress).
  storeCoins(toNano("0.2")). // amount
  storeBit(0). // Extra currency
  storeCoins(0). // IHR Fee
  storeCoins(0). // Forwarding Fee
  storeUint(0, 64). // Logical time of creation
  storeUint(0, 32). // UNIX time of creation
  storeBit(0). // No State Init
  storeBit(1). // We store Message Body as a reference
  storeRef(internalMessageBody). // Store Message Body as a reference
  endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/address"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tlb"
)

walletAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your address")

internalMessage := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0, 1). // indicate that it is an internal message -> int_msg_info$0
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // IHR Disabled
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // bounce
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // bounced
  MustStoreUInt(0, 2). // src -> addr_none
  MustStoreAddr(walletAddress).
  MustStoreCoins(tlb.MustFromTON("0.2").NanoTON().Uint64()).   // amount

  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // We store Message Body as a reference
  MustStoreRef(internalMessageBody). // Store Message Body as a reference
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Creating a Message

It is necessary to retrieve the `seqno` (sequence number) of our wallet smart contract. To accomplish this, a `Client` is created which will be used to send a request to run the Get method "seqno" of our wallet. It is also necessary to add a mnemonic seed phrase (which you saved during creating a wallet [here](#--external-and-internal-transactions)) to sign our transaction via the following steps:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { TonClient } from "ton";
import { mnemonicToWalletKey } from "ton-crypto";

const client = new TonClient({
  endpoint: "https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC",
  apiKey: "put your api key" // you can get an api key from @tonapibot bot in Telegram
});

const walletAddress = Address.parse('put your wallet address');
const mnemonic = 'put your mnemonic'; // word1 word2 word3
let getMethodResult = await client.runMethod(Address.parse(walletAddress), "seqno"); // run "seqno" GET method from your wallet contract
let seqno = getMethodResult.stack.readNumber(); // get seqno from response

const mnemonicArray = mnemonic.split(' '); // get array from string
const keyPair = await mnemonicToWalletKey(mnemonicArray); // get Secret and Public keys from mnemonic 
```

</Tabs>

Therefore, the `seqno`, `keys`, and `internal message` need to be sent. Now we need to create a [message](/develop/smart-contracts/messages) for our wallet and store the data in this message in the sequence used at the beginning of the tutorial. This is accomplished as follows:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { sign } from 'ton-crypto';

let toSign = beginCell().
  storeUint(698983191, 32). // subwallet_id | We consider this further
  storeUint(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1e3) + 60, 32). // Transaction expiration time, +60 = 1 minute
  storeUint(seqno, 32). // store seqno
  storeUint(3, 8). // store mode of our internal transaction
  storeRef(internalMessage); // store our internalMessage as a reference

let signature = sign(toSign.endCell().hash(), keyPair.secretKey); // get the hash of our message to wallet smart contract and sign it to get signature

let body = beginCell().
  storeBuffer(signature). // store signature
  storeBuilder(toSign). // store our message
  endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "time"
)

toSign := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(698983191, 32). // subwallet_id | We consider this further
  MustStoreUInt(uint64(time.Now().UTC().Unix()+60), 32). // Transaction expiration time, +60 = 1 minute
  MustStoreUInt(seqno.Uint64(), 32). // store seqno
  MustStoreUInt(uint64(3), 8). // store mode of our internal transaction
  MustStoreRef(internalMessage) // store our internalMessage as a reference

signature := ed25519.Sign(privateKey, toSign.EndCell().Hash()) // get the hash of our message to wallet smart contract and sign it to get signature

body := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreSlice(signature, 512). // store signature
  MustStoreBuilder(toSign). // store our message
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that here no `.endCell()` was used in the definition of the `toSign`. The fact is that in this case it is necessary **to transfer toSign content directly to the message body**. If writing a cell was required, it would have to be stored as a reference.


:::tip Wallet V4
In addition to basic verification process we learned bellow for the Wallet V3, Wallet V4 smart contracts [extracts the opcode to determine whether a simple translation or a transaction associated with the plugin](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/4111fd9e3313ec17d99ca9b5b1656445b5b49d8f/func/wallet-v4-code.fc#L94-L100) is required. To match this version, it is necessary to add the `storeUint(0, 8)`. (JS/TS), `MustStoreUInt(0, 8)`. (Golang) structures after writing the seqno (sequence number) and before specifying the transaction mode.
:::

### External Transaction Creation

To deliver any internal message to a blockchain from the outside world, it is necessary to send it within an external transaction. As we have previously considered, it is necessary to only make use of the `ext_in_msg_info$10` structure, as the goal is to send an external message to our contract. Now, let's create an external message that will be sent to our wallet:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
let externalMessage = beginCell().
  storeUint(0b10, 2). // 0b10 -> 10 in binary
  storeUint(0, 2). // src -> addr_none
  storeAddress(walletAddress). // Destination address
  storeCoins(0). // Import Fee
  storeBit(0). // No State Init
  storeBit(1). // We store Message Body as a reference
  storeRef(body). // Store Message Body as a reference
  endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
externalMessage := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0b10, 2). // 0b10 -> 10 in binary
  MustStoreUInt(0, 2). // src -> addr_none
  MustStoreAddr(walletAddress). // Destination address
  MustStoreCoins(0). // Import Fee
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // No State Init
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // We store Message Body as a reference
  MustStoreRef(body). // Store Message Body as a reference
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Option | Explanation
:---: | :---:
Src | The sender address. Since an incoming external message cannot have a sender, there will always be 2 zero bits (an addr_none [TL-B](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L100))
Import Fee | The fee used to pay for importing incoming external messages.
State Init | Unlike the Internal Message, the State Init within the external message is needed **to deploy a contract from the outside world**. The State Init used in conjunction with the Internal Message allows one contract to deploy another.
Message Body | The message that must be sent to the contract for processing.

:::tip 0b10
0b10 (b - binary) denotes a binary record. In this process, two bits are stored: `1` and `0`. Therefore, it is necessary to specify that it‚Äôs `ext_in_msg_info$10`.
:::

Now we have a completed message that is ready to be sent to our contract. To accomplish this, it should first be serialized to a `BOC` ([Bag of Cells](/develop/data-formats/cell-boc#bag-of-cells)), then be sent using the following code:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
console.log(externalMessage.toBoc().toString("base64"))

client.sendFile(externalMessage.toBoc());
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "encoding/base64"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tl"
)

log.Println(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(externalMessage.ToBOCWithFlags(false)))

var resp tl.Serializable
err = client.Client().QueryLiteserver(context.Background(), ton.SendMessage{Body: externalMessage.ToBOCWithFlags(false)}, &resp)

if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln(err.Error())
  return
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> üí° Useful link:
>
> [More about Bag of Cells](/develop/data-formats/cell-boc#bag-of-cells)

As a result, we got the output of our BOC in the console.  By copying the base64 encoded string, it is possible to [manually send our transaction and retrieve the hash using toncenter](https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/send/send_boc_return_hash_sendBocReturnHash_post).

## üëõ Deploying a Wallet

We have learned the basics of creating messages, which will now be helpful for deploying the wallet. In the past, we have deployed wallet via wallet app, but in this case we‚Äôll need to deploy our wallet manually.

In this section we‚Äôll go over how to create a wallet(wallet v3) from scratch. You‚Äôll learn how to compile the code for a wallet smart contract, generate a mnemonic phrase, receive a wallet address, and deploy a wallet using external transactions and State Init (state initialization).

### Generating A Mnemonic

The first thing needed to correctly create a wallet is to retrieve a `private` and `public` key. To accomplish this task it is necessary to generate a mnemonic seed phrase and then extract private and public keys using cryptographic libraries. 

This is accomplished as follows:


<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { mnemonicToWalletKey, mnemonicNew } from "ton-crypto";

const mnemonicArray = await mnemonicNew(24); // 24 is the number of words in a seed phrase
const keyPair = await mnemonicToWalletKey(mnemonicArray); // extract private and public keys from mnemonic
console.log(mnemonicArray) // if we want, we can print our mnemonic
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
	"crypto/ed25519"
	"crypto/hmac"
	"crypto/sha512"
	"log"
	"github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/ton/wallet"
	"golang.org/x/crypto/pbkdf2"
	"strings"
)

mnemonic := wallet.NewSeed() // get new mnemonic

// The following three lines will extract the private key using the mnemonic phrase. We will not go into cryptographic details. It has all been implemented in the tonutils-go library, but it immediately returns the finished object of the wallet with the address and ready methods. So we‚Äôll have to write the lines to get the key separately. Goland IDE will automatically import all required libraries (crypto, pbkdf2 and others).
mac := hmac.New(sha512.New, []byte(strings.Join(mnemonic, " "))) 
hash := mac.Sum(nil)
k := pbkdf2.Key(hash, []byte("TON default seed"), 100000, 32, sha512.New) // In TON libraries "TON default seed" is used as salt when getting keys
// 32 is a key len 

privateKey := ed25519.NewKeyFromSeed(k) // get private key
publicKey := privateKey.Public().(ed25519.PublicKey) // get public key from private key
log.Println(publicKey) // print publicKey so that at this stage the compiler does not complain that we do not use our variable
log.Println(mnemonic) // if we want, we can print our mnemonic
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The private key is needed to sign transactions and the public key is stored in the wallet‚Äôs smart contract.

:::danger IMPORTANT
It is necessary to output the generated mnemonic seed phrase to the console then save and use it (as detailed in the previous section) in order to use the same key pair each time the wallet‚Äôs code is run.
:::

### Subwallet IDs

One of the most notable benefits of wallets being smart contracts is the ability to create **a vast number of wallets** using just one private key. This is because the addresses of smart contracts on TON Blockchain are computed using several factors including the `stateInit`. The stateInit contains the `code` and `initial data`, which is stored in the blockchain‚Äôs smart contract storage.

By changing just one bit within the stateInit, a different address can be generated. That is why the `subwallet_id` specification was initially created. The  `subwallet_id` specification is stored in the contract storage and it can be used to create many different wallets (with different subwallet IDs) with one private key. This functionality can be very useful when integrating various wallet types with centralized service such as exchanges.

The default subwallet_id value is `698983191` according to the [line of code](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/4b940f8bad9c2d3bf44f196f6995963c7cee9cc3/tonlib/tonlib/TonlibClient.cpp#L2420) below taken from the TON Blockchain‚Äôs source code:

```cpp
res.wallet_id = td::as<td::uint32>(res.config.zero_state_id.root_hash.as_slice().data());
```

It is possible to retrieve genesis block information (zero_state) from the [configuration file](https://ton.org/global-config.json). Understanding the complexities and details of this is not always necessary but it's important to remember that the default value of the `subwallet_id` is `698983191`.

Each wallet contract checks the subwallet_id field for external transactions to avoid instances when requests were sent to another wallet:

```func
var (subwallet_id, valid_until, msg_seqno) = (cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(32));
var (stored_seqno, stored_subwallet, public_key) = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(256));
throw_unless(34, subwallet_id == stored_subwallet);
```

We will need to add the above value to the initial data of the contract, so the variable needs to be saved as follows:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const subWallet = 698983191;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
var subWallet uint32 = 698983191 // we use 32 bit for subwallet_id
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Compiling Wallet Code

Now that we have the private and public keys and the subwallet_id clearly defined we need to compile the wallet code. To accomplish this, we‚Äôll use the [wallet v3 code](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/wallet3-code.fc) from the official repository.

To compile wallet code it is necessary to use the [@ton-community/func-js](https://github.com/ton-community/func-js) library.
Using this library it allows us to compile FunC code and retrieve a cell containing the code. To get started, it is necessary to install the library and save (--save) it to the `package.json` as follows:

```bash
npm i --save @ton-community/func-js
```

We‚Äôll only use JavaScript to compile code, as the libraries for compiling code are JavaScript based.
However, after compiling is finalized, as long as we have the **base64 output** of our cell and it is possible to code in languages such as Go and others.

First, we need to create two files: `wallet_v3.fc` and `stdlib.fc`. The compiler works with the stdlib.fc library. All necessary and basic functions, which correspond with the `asm` instructions were created in the library. The stdlib.fc file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/stdlib.fc). In the  `wallet_v3.fc` file it is necessary to copy the code above. Now we have the following structure for the project we are creating:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wallet_v3.fc
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stdlib.fc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nodemon.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

:::info
Do not worry if your IDE plugin conflicts with `() set_seed(int) impure asm "SETRAND";` in `stdlib.fc`.
:::

Remember to add the following line to the beginning of wallet_v3.fc to indicate that the functions from stdlib will be used below: 

```func
#include "stdlib.fc";
```

Now let‚Äôs write code to compile our smart contract and run it using `npm run start:dev`:

```js
import { compileFunc } from '@ton-community/func-js';
import fs from 'fs'; // we use fs for reading content of files
import { Cell } from "ton-core";

const result = await compileFunc({
targets: ['wallet_v3.fc'], // targets of your project
sources: {
    "stdlib.fc": fs.readFileSync('./src/stdlib.fc', { encoding: 'utf-8' }),
    "wallet_v3.fc": fs.readFileSync('./src/wallet_v3.fc', { encoding: 'utf-8' }),
}
});

if (result.status === 'error') {
console.error(result.message)
return;
}

const codeCell = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(result.codeBoc, "base64"))[0]; // get buffer from base64 encoded BOC and get cell from this buffer

// now we have base64 encoded BOC with compiled code in result.codeBoc
console.log('Code BOC: ' + result.codeBoc);
console.log('\nHash: ' + codeCell.hash().toString('base64')); // get the hash of cell and convert in to base64 encoded string. We will need it further
```

You should get the following output to the terminal:

```text
Code BOC: te6ccgEBCAEAhgABFP8A9KQT9LzyyAsBAgEgAgMCAUgEBQCW8oMI1xgg0x/TH9MfAvgju/Jj7UTQ0x/TH9P/0VEyuvKhUUS68qIE+QFUEFX5EPKj+ACTINdKltMH1AL7AOgwAaTIyx/LH8v/ye1UAATQMAIBSAYHABe7Oc7UTQ0z8x1wv/gAEbjJftRNDXCx+A==

Hash: idlku00WfSC36ujyK2JVT92sMBEpCNRUXOGO4sJVBPA=
```

And now we can, using base64 encoded output, get the same cell with our wallet code in other libraries in other languages:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "encoding/base64"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tvm/cell"
)

base64BOC := "te6ccgEBCAEAhgABFP8A9KQT9LzyyAsBAgEgAgMCAUgEBQCW8oMI1xgg0x/TH9MfAvgju/Jj7UTQ0x/TH9P/0VEyuvKhUUS68qIE+QFUEFX5EPKj+ACTINdKltMH1AL7AOgwAaTIyx/LH8v/ye1UAATQMAIBSAYHABe7Oc7UTQ0z8x1wv/gAEbjJftRNDXCx+A==" // save our base64 encoded output from compiler to variable
codeCellBytes, _ := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(base64BOC) // decode base64 in order to get byte array
codeCell, err := cell.FromBOC(codeCellBytes) // get cell with code from byte array
if err != nil { // check if there are any error
  panic(err) 
}

log.Println("Hash:", base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(codeCell.Hash())) // get the hash of our cell, encode it to base64 because it has []byte type and output to the terminal
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



You should get the following output to the terminal:

```text
idlku00WfSC36ujyK2JVT92sMBEpCNRUXOGO4sJVBPA=
```

So we have confirmed that we have the right code in our cell because the hashes match.

### Creating State Init for deploy

Before building a transaction, we will understand what is a State Init. First lets go through the [TL-B scheme](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/block/block.tlb#L141-L143):

Option | Explanation
:---: | :---:
split_depth | This option is intended for highly loaded smart contracts that can be split and located on several [shardchains](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain#many-accountchains-shards). Information about this can be found in [tblkch.pdf](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf) (4.1.6). We will store bit `0` since we have just a wallet smart contract.
special | Used for TicTok. Such smart contracts are automatically called every block. Not needed for ordinary contracts. Information about this can be found in [tblkch.pdf](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf) (4.1.6). We will store bit `0` because we do not need such a function.
code | The presence of bit `1` means the presence of the smart contract code as a reference.
data | The presence of bit `1` means the presence of the smart contract data as a reference.
library | A library that is resided on the [masterchain](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain#masterchain-blockchain-of-blockchains) and can be used by different smart contracts. We will not use this, so we will set bit to `0`. Information about this can be found in [tblkch.pdf](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf) (1.8.4).

Now we need to prepare the `initial data`, which will be in the storage of our contract immediately after the deployment:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { beginCell } from "ton-core";

const dataCell = beginCell().
  storeUint(0, 32). // Seqno
  storeUint(698983191, 32). // Subwallet ID
  storeBuffer(keyPair.publicKey). // Public Key
  endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
dataCell := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0, 32). // Seqno
  MustStoreUInt(698983191, 32). // Subwallet ID
  MustStoreSlice(publicKey, 256). // Public Key
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

At this stage, we have both the contract `code` and its `initial data`. With this data, we can finally get our **wallet address**. As previously considered, the address of the wallet depends on the State Init, which includes the code and initial data.

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Address } from "ton-core";

const stateInit = beginCell().
  storeBit(0). // No split_depth
  storeBit(0). // No special
  storeBit(1). // We have code
  storeRef(codeCell).
  storeBit(1). // We have data
  storeRef(dataCell).
  storeBit(0). // No library
  endCell();

const contractAddress = new Address(0, stateInit.hash()); // get the hash of stateInit to get the address of our smart contract in workchain with ID 0
console.log(`Contract address: ${contractAddress.toString()}`); // Output contract address to console
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/address"
)

stateInit := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // No split_depth
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // No special
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // We have code
  MustStoreRef(codeCell).
  MustStoreBoolBit(true). // We have data
  MustStoreRef(dataCell).
  MustStoreBoolBit(false). // No library
  EndCell()

contractAddress := address.NewAddress(0, 0, stateInit.Hash()) // get the hash of stateInit to get the address of our smart contract in workchain with ID 0
log.Println("Contract address:", contractAddress.String()) // Output contract address to console
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With State Init, we can now build the transaction and send it to the blockchain. But keep in mind that we need to have **at least 0.1 TON** on balance (it can be less, but this amount is guaranteed to be enough). To do this, you need to run the entire code earlier, get the wallet address and send 0.1 TON to your wallet.

Let‚Äôs start with building the transaction we built *in the previous section*:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { sign } from "ton-crypto";
import { toNano } from "ton-core";

const internalMessageBody = beginCell().
  storeUint(0, 32).
  storeStringTail("Hello, TON!").
  endCell();

const internalMessage = beginCell().
  storeUint(0x10, 6). // no bounce
  storeAddress(Address.parse("put your first wallet address from were you sent 0.1 TON")).
  storeCoins(toNano("0.03")).
  storeUint(1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1). // We store 1 that means we have body as a reference
  storeRef(internalMessageBody).
  endCell();

// transaction for our wallet
const toSign = beginCell().
  storeUint(subWallet, 32).
  storeUint(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1e3) + 60, 32).
  storeUint(0, 32). // We put seqno = 0, because after deploying wallet will store 0 as seqno
  storeUint(3, 8).
  storeRef(internalMessage);

const signature = sign(toSign.endCell().hash(), keyPair.secretKey);
const body = beginCell().
  storeBuffer(signature).
  storeBuilder(toSign).
  endCell();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tlb"
  "time"
)

internalMessageBody := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0, 32).
  MustStoreStringSnake("Hello, TON!").
  EndCell()

internalMessage := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0x10, 6). // no bounce
  MustStoreAddr(address.MustParseAddr("put your first wallet address from were you sent 0.1 TON")).
  MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromTON("0.03").NanoTON()).
  MustStoreUInt(1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1). // We store 1 that means we have body as a reference
  MustStoreRef(internalMessageBody).
  EndCell()

// transaction for our wallet
toSign := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(subWallet, 32).
  MustStoreUInt(uint64(time.Now().UTC().Unix()+60), 32).
  MustStoreUInt(0, 32). // We put seqno = 0, because after deploying wallet will store 0 as seqno
  MustStoreUInt(3, 8).
  MustStoreRef(internalMessage)

signature := ed25519.Sign(privateKey, toSign.EndCell().Hash())
body := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreSlice(signature, 512).
  MustStoreBuilder(toSign).
	EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we have State Init and Message Body.

### Sending an external transaction

The **main change** will be in the external message, because here the State Init will be stored for deploying. Since the contract does not have its own code yet, it cannot process any internal messages. So we send its code and the initial data and **after the deployment it can process our message** with "Hello, TON!":

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const externalMessage = beginCell().
  storeUint(0b10, 2). // indicate that it is an incoming external transaction
  storeUint(0, 2). // src -> addr_none
  storeAddress(contractAddress).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that we have sent an internal transaction with mode `3`. If you want to repeat the deploying of the same wallet, **you can destroy the smart contract**. To do this, set the mode 128 (take the entire balance of the smart contract) + 32 (destroy the smart contract) = `160` to get all the remaining TON on the balance back and be able to deploy the wallet again. 

**Do not forget** that with each new transaction you will need **to increase seqno by one**.

## üí∏ Working with wallet smart contracts

Now we can work fully with wallet smart contracts. We can deploy and destroy them, send the needed transactions and not depend on pre-prepared library methods. During the study, we sent transactions with TON and comments. To apply more studies in practice, we will try to build and send more complex transactions.

### Sending multiple messages simultaneously

As you may already know, [one cell can store up to 1023 bits of data and up to 4 references](/develop/data-formats/cell-boc#cell) to other cells. In the first section of the tutorial we covered that internal messages are delivered in a while loop as a link and sent. This means it is possible to **store up to 4 internal messages inside the external**. This way, we can send four transactions at once.

To do this, it is necessary to create 4 different internal messages. We can do this manually or through a `loop`. Create `three arrays`: in first TON amount for each transaction will be stored; in the second - a comment; and the last - the destination address. We will also create another array for our messages:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Cell } from "ton-core";

const internalMessagesAmount = ["0.01", "0.02", "0.03", "0.04"];
const internalMessagesComment = [
  "Hello, TON! #1",
  "Hello, TON! #2",
  "", // Let's leave the third transaction without comment
  "Hello, TON! #4" 
]
const destinationAddresses = [
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you"
] // All 4 addresses can be the same

let internalMessages:Cell[] = []; // array for our internal messages
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tvm/cell"
)

internalMessagesAmount := [4]string{"0.01", "0.02", "0.03", "0.04"}
internalMessagesComment := [4]string{
  "Hello, TON! #1",
  "Hello, TON! #2",
  "", // Let's leave the third transaction without comment
  "Hello, TON! #4",
}
destinationAddresses := [4]string{
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
  "Put any address that belongs to you",
} // All 4 addresses can be the same

var internalMessages [len(internalMessagesAmount)]*cell.Cell // array for our internal messages
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For transactions mode, we will not create an array because all transactions will be sent with `mode 3`, but if you require different modes, you can create an array for that too. Now create a loop in which our internal messages will be built and add them to the array:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">

      storeUint(0x18, 6). // bounce
      storeAddress(Address.parse(destinationAddresses[index])).
      storeCoins(toNano(amount)).
      storeUint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1);
      
  /*
      At this stage, it is not clear if we will have a message body. 
      So put a bit only for stateInit, and if we have a comment, in means 
      we have a body message. In that case, set the bit to 1 and store the 
      body as a reference.
  */

  if(internalMessagesComment[index] != "") {
    internalMessage.storeBit(1) // we store Message Body as a reference

    let internalMessageBody = beginCell().
      storeUint(0, 32).
      storeStringTail(internalMessagesComment[index]).
      endCell();

    internalMessage.storeRef(internalMessageBody);
  } 
  else 
    /*
        Since we do not have a message body, we indicate that 
        the message body is in this message, but do not write it,

        Message Body as an empty cell (beginCell().endCell())
    */
    internalMessage.storeBit(0);
  
  internalMessages.push(internalMessage.endCell());
}
```

And now add our messages that we built earlier in the loop:

:::info Connection error
If you get an error with the lite-server connection (Golang), just run the code until you can send the transaction. This is because the tonutils-go library uses many lite-servers from the global config that we have specified in the code, but not all lite-servers can accept our connection.
:::

After that, we can go to any explorer and see that **our wallet sent four transactions** to the addresses you previously specified.

### NFT Transfer

In addition to regular translations, users often send NFT to each other. At the same time, not all libraries contain methods to help with this type of smart contract. So we will write a code that will build a transaction for sending an NFT. But before that, we lets look at some details of the [standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md).

We need [TL-B from this standard for the NFT transfer](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#1-transfer). As you may already know, TL-B describes various structures in TON Blockchain. Let‚Äôs look at some points that may not be immediately clear:

- `query_id`: This value can be set to 0. It is needed to separate different NFT transfer requests. Used in different services, that is, what query_id will be, depends only on the service and the purpose for which it will use it.

- `response_destination`: After processing the ownership change transaction there will be extra TON. They will be sent to this address, if specified, otherwise remain on the NFT balance.

- `custom_payload`: Needed for specific tasks. Not used in ordinary NFT.

- `forward_amount`: If this field is not zero, the specified amount of TON will be sent to the new owner. That way new owner will be notified that he received something.

- `forward_payload`: This is an additional data that can be sent to the new owner together with forward_amount. For example, using forward_payload you can [add a comment during the transfer of the NFT](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#forward_payload-format), as we did earlier in the tutorial. However, the problem is that although it is written in the standard, the explorers do not fully support it. **In the case of Jettons the same problem is present**.

Now let's move on to building the transaction itself:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Address, beginCell, toNano } from "ton-core";

const destinationAddress = Address.parse("put your wallet where you want to send NFT");
const walletAddress = Address.parse("put your wallet which is the owner of NFT")
const nftAddress = Address.parse("put your nft address");

// We can add a comment, but it will not be displayed in the explorers, 
// as it is not supported by them at the time of writing the tutorial.
const forwardPayload = beginCell().
  storeUint(0, 32).
  storeStringTail("Hello, TON!").
  endCell();

const transferNftBody = beginCell().
  storeUint(0x5fcc3d14, 32). // Opcode for NFT transfer
  storeUint(0, 64). // query_id
  storeAddress(destinationAddress). // new_owner
  storeAddress(walletAddress). // response_destination for excesses
  storeBit(0). // we do not have custom_payload
  storeCoins(toNano("0.01")). // forward_payload
  storeBit(1). // we store forward_payload as a reference
  storeRef(forwardPayload). // store forward_payload as a reference
  endCell();

const internalMessage = beginCell().
  storeUint(0x18, 6). // bounce
  storeAddress(nftAddress).
  storeCoins(toNano("0.05")).
  storeUint(1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1). // We store 1 that means we have body as a reference
  storeRef(transferNftBody).
  endCell();
```

destinationAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your wallet where you want to send NFT")
walletAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your wallet which is the owner of NFT")
nftAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your nft address")

// We can add a comment, but it will not be displayed in the explorers,
// as it is not supported by them at the time of writing the tutorial.
forwardPayload := cell.BeginCell().
  MustStoreUInt(0, 32).
  MustStoreStringSnake("Hello, TON!").
  EndCell()

  MustStoreRef(transferNftBody).
  EndCell()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Opcode came from [the same standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#tl-b-schema). All we have to do now is complete the transaction, as in the previous chapters. You can find the fully working code in the GitHub repository, which was attached at the beginning of the tutorial.

Then you can do the same with `Jettons`. You just need to read the TL-B for the transfer of tokens from [standart](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md) and understand how to collect the transaction. There is a small difference betwenn NFT and Jettons transfer.

### Get methods in Wallet V3 and Wallet v4

Smart contracts can have GET methods. These are functions that can take arguments, process various data and return a response. However, the essence of GET methods is that they are run not inside the blockchain, but **on the client side**. These methods are very useful and provide different data on smart contracts. For example, [get_nft_data() method in NFT smart contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/991bdb4925653c51b0b53ab212c53143f71f5476/nft/nft-item.fc#L142-L145) allows you to get **content**, **owner**, **collection** .

We will study the basic GET methods of [V3](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/e37583e5e6e8cd0aebf5142ef7d8db282f10692b/crypto/smartcont/wallet3-code.fc#L31-L41) and [V4](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/4111fd9e3313ec17d99ca9b5b1656445b5b49d8f/func/wallet-v4-code.fc#L164-L198) Wallets, as well as learn how to pass arguments and read the response. Let‚Äôs start with the methods that are the same for the two versions:

Method | Explanation
:---: | :---:
int seqno() | At this stage you already know what seqno is. This method is needed to receive the **current seqno** and send transactions with the correct value. In previous chapters, we were calling this method all the time.
int get_public_key() | Getting a public key. Not broadly used, can be used by different services. For example, some API services allow you to find all wallets with the same public key. In this case, it is useful to be able to receive the keys in advance through this method.

Now let‚Äôs move to the methods that only V4 possesses:

Method | Explanation
:---: | :---:
int get_subwallet_id() | Earlier in the tutorial we considered this. This method allows you to get subwallet_id.
int is_plugin_installed(int wc, int addr_hash) | Lets us know if the plugin has been installed. To call, you should pass the [workchain](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain#workchain-blockchain-with-your-own-rules) and the plugin address hash.
tuple get_plugin_list() | This method returns the address of the plugins that are installed.

We look at two methods: `get_public_key` and `is_plugin_installed`. They have been chosen because at first we would have to get a public key from 256 bits of data, and after that we would have to learn how to pass a slice and different types of data to GET methods. This will be very useful in learning how to use these methods.

First we need a client who will send requests. I will use my wallet address ([EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF](https://tonscan.org/address/EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF)) as an example:

After the call we get a huge number (256 bits), which must be translated into hex string. Hex string for my address: `430db39b13cf3cb76bfa818b6b13417b82be2c6c389170fbe06795c71996b1f8`. Now we can use [TonAPI](https://tonapi.io/swagger-ui) (/v1/wallet/findByPubkey method), put the obtained hex string and see that the first element in the array in the answer will point to my wallet.

Now we can switch to `is_plugin_installed`. As an example I will use my old wallet ([EQAM7M-HGyfxlErAIUODrxBA3y5roBeYiTuy6BHgJ3Sx8k](https://tonscan.org/address/EQAM7M--HGyfxlErAIUODrxBA3yj5roBeYiTuy6BHgJ3Sx8k)) and the plugin ([EQBTKTis-SWYdupy99ozeOvnEBu8LRrQP_N9qwOTSAy3sQSZ](https://tonscan.org/address/EQBTKTis-SWYdupy99ozeOvnEBu8LRrQP_N9qwOTSAy3sQSZ)) that will be installed for at least a few decades:

Now we need to get the hash address of our plugin. After that we can translate it into number and send it to GET Method.

In the response we have to get `-1`, which means true. We could send a **slice** and a **cell** if required. It would be enough to create a Slice or Cell and transfer it instead of BigInt, specifying the appropriate type.

### Contract deploy via wallet

In chapter three, we deployed our wallet. To do this, we first sent some TON and then a transaction from this wallet to deploy the contract. However, it is not broadly used with external transactions and is primarily used for wallets. While developing contracts, the deployment process is initialized by **internal messages**. 

We will use the smart V3R2 wallet contract that was used in [the third chapter](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet#compiling-our-wallet-code). In this case, set `subwallet_id` to `3` or any other number that you want to get a different address when using the same private key (changeable):

This concludes our work with ordinary wallets. At this stage, you fully understand how to interact with wallet smart contracts, send the required transactions, and not to be dependent on a specific library.

## üî• High-load wallet

In some situations, sending a large number of transactions per message may be necessary. As previously reviewed, ordinary wallets support sending up to 4 transactions at a time. This was because [a maximum of 4 references](/develop/data-formats/cell-boc#cell) can be stored in a single cell. High-load wallets allow sending 255 transactions at once. This restriction exists because the maximum out messages in the blockchain config is set to 255.

Exchanges are the best example. With many users, it is necessary to send a lot of transactions for withdrawal per second.

### High-load wallet FunC code

First, let‚Äôs take a look at [the code of the high-load wallet smart contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/highload-wallet-v2-code.fc) , as we have done before: 

```func
() recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {
  var signature = in_msg~load_bits(512); ;; get signature from the message body
  var cs = in_msg;
  var (subwallet_id, query_id) = (cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(64)); ;; get rest values from the message body
  var bound = (now() << 32); ;; bitwise left shift operation
  throw_if(35, query_id < bound); ;; throw an error if transaction has expired
  var ds = get_data().begin_parse();
  var (stored_subwallet, last_cleaned, public_key, old_queries) = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(64), ds~load_uint(256), ds~load_dict()); ;; read values from storage
  ds.end_parse(); ;; make sure we do not have anything in ds
  (_, var found?) = old_queries.udict_get?(64, query_id); ;; check if we have already had such a request
  throw_if(32, found?); ;; if yes throw an error
  throw_unless(34, subwallet_id == stored_subwallet);
  throw_unless(35, check_signature(slice_hash(in_msg), signature, public_key));
  var dict = cs~load_dict(); ;; get dictionary with messages
  cs.end_parse(); ;; make sure we do not have anything in cs
  accept_message();
```

> üí° Useful links:
>
> ["Bitwise operations" in docs](/develop/func/stdlib/#dict_get)
>
> ["load_dict()" in docs](/develop/func/stdlib/#load_dict)
>
> ["udict_get?()" in docs](/develop/func/stdlib/#dict_get)

You can notice some differences from ordinary wallets. Now let‚Äôs take a closer look to every detail (except subwallet, since we have already studied this).

### Query ID instead of Seqno

As we have previously learned, ordinary wallets seqno is increased by `1` with each transaction. We had to wait until this value was updated, then get it using the GET method and send a new transaction. This took quite a lot of time ahead, which cannot be allowed in highload wallets. Therefore, `query_id` is used here.

This field allows us to identify each request, and if we already have some request, the contract will not accept it, as it has already been processed:

```func
var (stored_subwallet, last_cleaned, public_key, old_queries) = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(64), ds~load_uint(256), ds~load_dict()); ;; read values from storage
ds.end_parse(); ;; make sure we do not have anything in ds
(_, var found?) = old_queries.udict_get?(64, query_id); ;; check if we have already had such a request
throw_if(32, found?); ;; if yes throw an error
```

This way, we are **being protected from repeated transactions**, which was the role of seqno in ordinary wallets. 

### Sending transactions

After the contract has accepted the external message, a loop starts, in which the `slices` stored in the dictionary are taken. These slices store transactions modes and the transactions themselves. Sending takes place until the dictionary is empty:

```func
int i = -1; ;; we write -1 because it will be the smallest value among all dictionary keys
do {
  (i, var cs, var f) = dict.idict_get_next?(16, i); ;; get the key and its corresponding value with the smallest key, which is greater than i
  if (f) { ;; check if any value was found
    var mode = cs~load_uint(8); ;; load transaction mode
    send_raw_message(cs~load_ref(), mode); ;; load transaction itself and send it
  }
} until (~ f); ;; if any value was found continue
```

> üí° Useful link:
>
> ["idict_get_next()" in docs](/develop/func/stdlib/#dict_get_next)

Note that if a value is found, `f` will be -1 (true). The `~ -1` operation (bitwise not) will return 0, meaning that the loop should be continued. At the same time, when we fill the dictionary with our transactions, it is necessary to start the count **with a value greater than -1** (for example, 0) and continue increasing by 1 with each transaction. So all transactions will be sent in the sequence we wanted.

### Old queries removing

As you know, [smart contracts in TON pay for their storage](develop/smart-contracts/fees#storage-fee). So they can not store a lot of data in it, otherwise each transaction will be very expensive. For this, transactions that have expired more than 64 seconds ago are removed from the storage:

```func
bound -= (64 << 32);   ;; clean up records that have expired more than 64 seconds ago
old_queries~udict_set_builder(64, query_id, begin_cell()); ;; add current query to dictionary
var queries = old_queries; ;; copy dictionary to another variable
do {
  var (old_queries', i, _, f) = old_queries.udict_delete_get_min(64);
  f~touch();
  if (f) { ;; check if any value was found
    f = (i < bound); ;; check if more than 64 seconds have elapsed after expiration
  }
  if (f) { 
    old_queries = old_queries'; ;; if yes save changes in our dictionary
    last_cleaned = i; ;; save last removed query
  }
} until (~ f);
```

> üí° Useful link:
>
> ["udict_delete_get_min()" in docs](/develop/func/stdlib/#dict_delete_get_min)

Note that we have to interact with the `f` variable several times. Since [TVM is a stack machine](learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview#tvm-is-a-stack-machine), at each interaction with `f` it is necessary to pop all values to get the desired variable. The `f~touch()` operation places the variable at the top of the stack to optimize code execution.

### Bitwise left shift operation

This section may seem a bit complicated for those who have not previously worked with bruised operations. The following line can be seen in the smart contract code:

```func
var bound = (now() << 32); ;; bitwise left shift operation
```

As a result 32 bits are added to the number on the right side. This means that **existing values are moved to 32 bits to the left**. For example, take the number 3, translate it into a binary form, and get 11. Applying the `3 << 2` operation, 11 is moved by two bits. That is, two bits are added to the right. In the end, we have 1100, which is 12.

First thing to do in order to understand why this is done is to remember that `now()` returns us uint32, which means that the number will be 32 bits. By shifting it to 32 bits to the left, we get space for another uint32, which is query_id. This way, **timestamp and query_id can be combined** within one variable for optimization.

Next, consider the following line:

```func
bound -= (64 << 32); ;; clean up the records that have expired more than 64 seconds ago
```

Here we perform the operation of shifting the number 64 by 32 bits. We do this in order to **subtract 64 seconds** from our timestamp. This way we will be able to compare past query_ids and see if they are less than the received value. If so, they expired more than 64 seconds ago:

```func
if (f) { ;; check if any value has been found
  f = (i < bound); ;; check if more than 64 seconds have elapsed after expiration
}
```

To understand this better, take `1625918400` as an example of timestamp. Its binary representation (with the left-handed addition of zeros for 32 bits) is 01100000111010011000101111000000. By performing a bitwise left shift by 32 bits, we get 32 zeros at the end of the binary representation of our number. 

After that **we can add any query_id (uint32)**. Then subtracting `64 << 32`, we get a timestamp that was 64 seconds ago with the same query_id. We can make sure of that by performing `((1625918400 << 32) - (64 << 32)) >> 32`. This way we can compare the necessary part of our number (which is timestamp) and at the same time query_id does not interfere.

### Storage update

After all the operations are done, only remaining thing is to save new values in the storage:

```func
  set_data(begin_cell()
    .store_uint(stored_subwallet, 32)
    .store_uint(last_cleaned, 64)
    .store_uint(public_key, 256)
    .store_dict(old_queries)
    .end_cell());
}
```

### GET Methods

The last thing we have to consider before we go to deployment and transactions creation is GET methods of high-load wallet: 

Method | Explanation
:---: | :---:
int processed?(int query_id) | Lets us know if a particular request has been processed. Returns `-1` if yes and `0` if no. Also, this method may return `1` if the answer is unknown since this request is old and no longer stored in the contract.
int get_public_key() | Getting a public key. We have considered this method before.

Let‚Äôs look at `int processed?(int query_id)` closely because it will help us to understand why we need last_cleaned:

```func
int processed?(int query_id) method_id {
  var ds = get_data().begin_parse();
  var (_, last_cleaned, _, old_queries) = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(64), ds~load_uint(256), ds~load_dict());
  ds.end_parse();
  (_, var found) = old_queries.udict_get?(64, query_id);
  return found ? true : - (query_id <= last_cleaned);
}
```

We get `last_cleaned` from the storage of the contract and a dictionary of old queries. If the query is found, it will be returned true, and if not, the expression `- (query_id <= last_cleaned)`. last_cleaned contains the last removed request **with the highest timestamp**, as we started with the minimum timestamp when deleting the requests. 

This means that if the query_id passed to the method is smaller than last_cleaned, it is impossible to determine whether it was ever in the contract or not, so the `query_id <= last_cleaned` returns -1, and the minus before this expression changes the answer to 1. If query_id is larger than last_cleaned, then it has not yet been processed.

### Deploying high-load wallet

Here we will only go into a few details as they were detailed previously in this tutorial. It is necessary to generate a mnemonic key in advance, which you will use. You can use the same key that was used in any of the previous chapters of this tutorial. 

First, we need to copy [the code of the smart contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/highload-wallet-v2-code.fc) to the same directory where stdlib.fc and wallet_v3 are located and remember to add the code `#include "stdlib.fc";` to the beginning of the code. Then we should compile the code of high-load wallet as we did in [chapter three](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet#compiling-our-wallet-code):

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { compileFunc } from '@ton-community/func-js';
import fs from 'fs'
import { Cell } from 'ton-core';

const result = await compileFunc({
    targets: ['highload_wallet.fc'], // targets of your project
    sources: {
        'stdlib.fc': fs.readFileSync('./src/stdlib.fc', { encoding: 'utf-8' }),
        'highload_wallet.fc': fs.readFileSync('./src/highload_wallet.fc', { encoding: 'utf-8' }),
    }
});

if (result.status === 'error') {
console.error(result.message)
return;
}

const codeCell = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(result.codeBoc, 'base64'))[0];

// now we have base64 encoded BOC with compiled code in result.codeBoc
console.log('Code BOC: ' + result.codeBoc);
console.log('\nHash: ' + codeCell.hash().toString('base64')); // get the hash of cell and convert in to base64 encoded string

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should get the following output to the terminal:

```text
Code BOC: te6ccgEBCQEA5QABFP8A9KQT9LzyyAsBAgEgAgMCAUgEBQHq8oMI1xgg0x/TP/gjqh9TILnyY+1E0NMf0z/T//QE0VNggED0Dm+hMfJgUXO68qIH+QFUEIf5EPKjAvQE0fgAf44WIYAQ9HhvpSCYAtMH1DAB+wCRMuIBs+ZbgyWhyEA0gED0Q4rmMQHIyx8Tyz/L//QAye1UCAAE0DACASAGBwAXvZznaiaGmvmOuF/8AEG+X5dqJoaY+Y6Z/p/5j6AmipEEAgegc30JjJLb/JXdHxQANCCAQPSWb6VsEiCUMFMDud4gkzM2AZJsIeKz

Hash: lJTRzI7fEvBWcaGpugmSEJbrUIEeGSTsZcPGKfu4CBI=
```

And now we can, using base64 encoded output, get the same cell with our wallet code in other libraries in other languages:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go
import (
  "encoding/base64"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tvm/cell"
)

base64BOC := "te6ccgEBCQEA5QABFP8A9KQT9LzyyAsBAgEgAgMCAUgEBQHq8oMI1xgg0x/TP/gjqh9TILnyY+1E0NMf0z/T//QE0VNggED0Dm+hMfJgUXO68qIH+QFUEIf5EPKjAvQE0fgAf44WIYAQ9HhvpSCYAtMH1DAB+wCRMuIBs+ZbgyWhyEA0gED0Q4rmMQHIyx8Tyz/L//QAye1UCAAE0DACASAGBwAXvZznaiaGmvmOuF/8AEG+X5dqJoaY+Y6Z/p/5j6AmipEEAgegc30JjJLb/JXdHxQANCCAQPSWb6VsEiCUMFMDud4gkzM2AZJsIeKz" // save our base64 encoded output from compiler to variable
codeCellBytes, _ := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(base64BOC) // decode base64 in order to get byte array
codeCell, err := cell.FromBOC(codeCellBytes) // get cell with code from byte array
if err != nil { // check if there is any error
  panic(err) 
}

log.Println("Hash:", base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(codeCell.Hash())) // get the hash of our cell, encode it to base64 because it has []byte type and output to the terminal
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we need to get a cell with an initial data, build State Init and get high-load wallet address. We have already studied the smart contract code and have realized that subwallet_id, last_cleaned, public_key and old_queries are sequentially stored in the storage:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Address, beginCell } from 'ton-core';
import { mnemonicToWalletKey } from 'ton-crypto';

const highloadMnemonicArray = 'put your mnemonic that you have generated and saved before'.split(' ');
const highloadKeyPair = await mnemonicToWalletKey(highloadMnemonicArray); // extract private and public keys from mnemonic

const dataCell = beginCell().
    storeUint(698983191, 32). // Subwallet ID
    storeUint(0, 64). // Last cleaned
    storeBuffer(highloadKeyPair.publicKey). // Public Key
    storeBit(0). // indicate that the dictionary is empty
    endCell();

const stateInit = beginCell().
    storeBit(0). // No split_depth
    storeBit(0). // No special
    storeBit(1). // We have code
    storeRef(codeCell).
    storeBit(1). // We have data
    storeRef(dataCell).
    storeBit(0). // No library
    endCell();

const contractAddress = new Address(0, stateInit.hash()); // get the hash of stateInit to get the address of our smart contract in workchain with ID 0
console.log(`Contract address: ${contractAddress.toString()}`); // Output contract address to console
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

```go

)

highloadMnemonicArray := strings.Split("put your mnemonic that you have generated and saved before", " ") // word1 word2 word3
mac := hmac.New(sha512.New, []byte(strings.Join(highloadMnemonicArray, " ")))
hash := mac.Sum(nil)
k := pbkdf2.Key(hash, []byte("TON default seed"), 100000, 32, sha512.New) // In TON libraries "TON default seed" is used as salt when getting keys
// 32 is a key len
highloadPrivateKey := ed25519.NewKeyFromSeed(k)                      // get private key

### Sending transactions from high-load wallet

Now we need to send several messages at the same time from our highload wallet. For example, let's take 12 transactions per message so that the commission is small. Each message will have its own comment with a code, and the destination address will be our wallet from which we deployed:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Address, beginCell, Cell, toNano } from 'ton-core';

let internalMessages:Cell[] = [];
const walletAddress = Address.parse('put your wallet address from which you deployed high-load wallet');

for (let i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
    const internalMessageBody = beginCell().
        storeUint(0, 32).
        storeStringTail(`Hello, TON! #${i}`).
        endCell();

    const internalMessage = beginCell().
        storeUint(0x18, 6). // bounce
        storeAddress(walletAddress).
        storeCoins(toNano('0.01')).
        storeUint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32).
        storeBit(0). // We do not have State Init
        storeBit(1). // We store Message Body as a reference
        storeRef(internalMessageBody). // Store Message Body Init as a reference
        endCell();

    internalMessages.push(internalMessage);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go" label="Golang">

import (
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/address"
  "github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/tlb"

)

var internalMessages []*cell.Cell
wallletAddress := address.MustParseAddr("put your wallet address from which you deployed high-load wallet")

for i := 0; i < 12; i++ {
  comment := fmt.Sprintf("Hello, TON! #%d", i)
  internalMessageBody := cell.BeginCell().
    MustStoreUInt(0, 32).
    MustStoreBinarySnake([]byte(comment)).
    EndCell()

  internalMessage := cell.BeginCell().
    MustStoreUInt(0x18, 6). // bounce
    MustStoreAddr(wallletAddress).

  messageData := cell.BeginCell().
    MustStoreUInt(3, 8). // transaction mode
    MustStoreRef(internalMessage).
    EndCell()

	internalMessages = append(internalMessages, messageData)
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We now have an array of internal messages. We need to create a dictionary in which we will store our messages and also prepare and sign the body:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { Dictionary } from 'ton-core';
import { mnemonicToWalletKey, sign } from 'ton-crypto';
import * as crypto from 'crypto';

const dictionary = Dictionary.empty<number, Cell>(); // create an empty dictionary with the key as a number and the value as a cell
for (let i = 0; i < internalMessages.length; i++) {
    const internalMessage = internalMessages[i]; // get our message from an array
    dictionary.set(i, internalMessage); // save the message in the dictionary
}

const queryID = crypto.randomBytes(4).readUint32BE(); // create a random uint32 number, 4 bytes = 32 bits
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000); // get current timestamp
const timeout = 120; // timeout for message expiration, 120 seconds = 2 minutes
const finalQueryID = (BigInt(now + timeout) << 32n) + BigInt(queryID); // get our final query_id
console.log(finalQueryID); // print query_id. With this query_id we can call GET method to check if our request has been processed

const toSign = beginCell().
    storeUint(698983191, 32). // subwallet_id
    storeUint(finalQueryID, 64).
    // Here we create our own method that will save the 
    // transaction mode and a reference to the transaction
    storeDict(dictionary, Dictionary.Keys.Int(16), {
        serialize: (src, buidler) => {
            buidler.storeUint(3, 8); // save transaction mode, mode = 3
            buidler.storeRef(src); // save transaction as reference
        },
        // We won't actually use this, but this method 
        // will help to read our dictionary that we saved
        parse: (src) => {
            let cell = beginCell().
                storeUint(src.loadUint(8), 8).
                storeRef(src.loadRef()).
                endCell();
            return cell;
        }
    }
);

const highloadMnemonicArray = 'put your high-load wallet mnemonic'.split(' ');
const highloadKeyPair = await mnemonicToWalletKey(highloadMnemonicArray); // extract private and public keys from mnemonic
const highloadWalletAddress = Address.parse('put your high-load wallet address');

const signature = sign(toSign.endCell().hash(), highloadKeyPair.secretKey); // get the hash of our message to wallet smart contract and sign it to get signature

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note IMPORTANT
Note that on JS/TS we saved the messages into an array without a mode. TIt happens because the ton library leaves the implementation of serialization and de-serialization to the developer. Thus, we pass there a method that first saves the transaction mode, after which it saves the transaction itself. If we wrote `Dictionary.Values.Cell()` for value method, it would save our entire message as a cell reference without saving the fashion separately.
:::

Now we have to create an external message and send it to the blockchain:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
import { TonClient } from 'ton';

const body = beginCell().
    storeBuffer(signature). // store signature
    storeBuilder(toSign). // store our message
    endCell();

const externalMessage = beginCell().
    storeUint(0b10, 2). // indicate that it is an incoming external transaction
    storeUint(0, 2). // src -> addr_none
    storeAddress(highloadWalletAddress).
    storeCoins(0). // Import fee
    storeBit(0). // We do not have State Init
    storeBit(1). // We store Message Body as a reference
    storeRef(body). // Store Message Body as a reference
    endCell();

// We do not need a key here as we will be sending 1 request per second
const client = new TonClient({
    endpoint: 'https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
    // apiKey: 'put your api key' // you can get an api key from @tonapibot bot in Telegram
});

client.sendFile(externalMessage.toBoc());
```

var resp tl.Serializable

if err != nil {
  log.Fatalln(err.Error())

</Tabs>

After that we can go into any explorer and see 12 outgoing transactions on our wallet. We also can call GET method `processed?` with the query_id we had in the console and get `-1` (true), which means that our request has been processed. 

## üèÅ Conclusion

This tutorial studied wallets in TON Blockchain within the smallest details. At the same time, we learned how to create external and internal messages ourselves without using pre-prepared library methods. 

This helps us not only to be independent on libraries but also to understand the structure of TON Blockchain better. Additionally, we learned how to use the high-load wallet and analysed a lot of details about various operations with different types of data.

## üß© Next Steps

After thoroughly studying this tutorial, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the following documents in more detail.: [ton.pdf](https://ton.org/ton.pdf) and [tblkch.pdf](https://ton.org/tblkch.pdf).

It will be hard to understand everything, but it will be very useful in any case. Next, you can start learning how to write smart contracts: [FunC Overview](https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/overview), [Best Practices](https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines), [FunC Cookbook](https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/cookbook)
