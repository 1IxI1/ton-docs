# Cells, Builders and Slices

Cells is a low level primitive that represents data in TON blockchain. Cell consists of a 1023 bits of data with up to 4 references to another Cells. Cells are read-only and immutable. Builders are immutable structures that can be used to construct Cells. Slices are a way to parse cells.

## beginCell
```tact
fun beginCell(): Builder
```
Creates a new empty Builder.

## Builder.endCell
```tact
extends fun endCell(self: Builder): Cell;
```
Converts `Builder` into an ordinary `Cell`.

## Builder.storeUint
```tact
extends fun storeUint(self: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;
```
Stores an unsigned `bits`-bit integer `value` into `s` for `0 ≤ bits ≤ 256`.

## Builder.storeInt
```tact
extends fun storeInt(self: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;
```
Stores a signed `len`-bit integer `x` into `b` for `0 ≤ len ≤ 257`.

## Builder.storeBool
```tact
extends fun storeBool(self: Builder, value: Bool): Builder;
```
Stores Bool `value` into Builder `s`. It will write to `s` integer `x`.  `x = -1` if `value = True` or `x = 0` integer if `value = False`.

## Builder.storeSlice
```tact
extends fun storeSlice(self: Builder, cell: Slice): Builder;
```
Stores slice `cell` into builder `s`.

## Builder.storeCoins
```tact
extends fun storeCoins(self: Builder, value: Int): Builder;
```
Stores (serializes) an integer `value` in the range `0..2^120 − 1` into builder `s`. The serialization of `value` consists of a 4-bit unsigned big-endian integer `l`, which is the smallest integer `l ≥ 0`, such that `value < 2^8l`, followed by an `8l`-bit unsigned big-endian representation of `value`. If `value` does not belong to the supported range, a range check exception is thrown.

It is the most common way of storing Toncoins.

## Builder.storeAddress
```tact
extends fun storeAddress(self: Builder, address: Address): Builder;
```
Stores `address` in Builder `s`. About Address.

```tact
extends fun storeRef(self: Builder, cell: Cell): Builder;
```
Stores a reference `c` into builder `b` and returns updated `b'`.

## context
```tact
fun context(): Context;
```
Return Struct `Context`, that consists of

| Field   | Type    | Description                                                                                                               |

| raw     | Slice   | Slice reminder of message

## require
```tact
fun require(condition: Bool, error: String);
```
Checks `condition` and throws an exception with `error` message if `condition` is false.

## now
```tact
fun now(): Int
```
Returns current unixtime

## myBalance
```tact
myBalance(): Int;
```
Returns the remaining balance of the smart contract as Int value in NanoToncoins, where NanoToncoin = Toncoin * 10^(−9). Note that `send` do not update this field.

## myAddress
```tact
myAddress(): Address;
```
Returns the internal address of the current smart contract as a Address.

## contractAddress
```tact
fun contractAddress(s: StateInit): Address;
```
Computes smart contract's Address in a workchain #0 based on its StateInit `s`, where `s` is a Struct consists of `code` and `data` Cells.

## contractAddressExt
```tact
fun contractAddressExt(chain: Int, code: Cell, data: Cell): Address;
```
Computes smart contract's Address based on its workchain id `chain`, `code`, `data`.

# Math

Various math helper functions.

## checkSignature
```tact
fun checkSignature(hash: Int, signature: Slice, public_key: Int): Bool;
```
Checks the Ed25519 `signature` of `hash` (a 256-bit unsigned integer, usually computed as the hash of some data) using `public_key` (also represented by a 256-bit unsigned integer). The signature must contain at least 512 data bits; only the first 512 bits are used. If the signature is valid, the result is true; otherwise, it is false.
Note that `CHKSIGNU` creates a 256-bit slice with the `hash` and calls `CHKSIGNS`. That is, if hash is computed as the hash of some data, this data is hashed twice, the second hashing occurring inside `CHKSIGNS`.

## checkDataSignature
```tact
fun checkDataSignature(data: Slice, signature: Slice, public_key: Slice): Bool;
```
Checks whether `signature` is a valid Ed25519 signature of the data portion of `data` using `public_key`, similarly to `checkSignature`. If the bit length of `data` is not divisible by eight, it throws a cell underflow exception. The verification of Ed25519 signatures is a standard one, with sha256 used to reduce `data` to the 256-bit number that is actually signed. If the signature is valid, the result is true; otherwise, it is false.

## min
```tact
fun min(x: Int, y: Int): Int;
```
Computes the minimum of two integers `x` and `y`.

## max
```tact
fun max(x: Int, y: Int): Int;
```
Computes the maximum of two integers `x` and `y`.

## abs
```tact
fun abs(x: Int): Int
```
Computes the absolute value of the integer `x`.



# Random number generation

Random number generation in TON smart contracts.

## randomInt
```tact
fun randomInt(): Int;
```
Generates a new pseudo-random unsigned 256-bit integer `x`. The algorithm is as follows: if `r` is the old value of the random seed considered a 32-byte array (by constructing the big-endian representation of an unsigned 256-bit integer), then its `sha512(r)` is computed; the first 32 bytes of this hash are stored as the new value `r'` of the random seed, and the remaining 32 bytes are returned as the next random value `x`.

## random
```tact
fun random(from: Int, to: Int): Int;
```

Generates a new pseudo-random unsigned integer in provided interval: `from <= x <= to` or `from >= x >= to` (for negative values).


# Strings

Strings are a sequence of a characters. Strings are immutable, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Tact have a limitied support for strings, but you can use them to store text. Strings are also useful as comment messages body.

## beginString
```tact
fun beginString(): StringBuilder;
```
Creates new empty StringBuilder.

## beginComment
```tact
fun beginComment(): StringBuilder;
```
Creates new empty StringBuilder for comment.

## beginTailString
```tact
fun beginTailString(): StringBuilder;
```
Creates new empty StringBuilder for a tailstring. This format is used in various standards like NFT or Jetton.

## beginStringFromBuilder
```tact
fun beginStringFromBuilder(builder: Builder): StringBuilder;
```
Creates new StringBuilder from existing builder. Useful if you need to serialize string to a cell with some other data.

## StringBuilder.append
```tact
extends mutates fun append(self: StringBuilder, s: String);
```
Append to StringBuilder `self` String `s` and updates it.

## StringBuilder.toString
```tact
extends fun toString(self: StringBuilder): String;
```
Assembles a string from a builder's content.

## StringBuilder.toCell
```tact
extends fun toCell(self: StringBuilder): Cell
```
Assembles a cell from a builder's content.

## StringBuilder.toSlice
```tact
extends fun toSlice(self: StringBuilder): Slice;
```
Assembles a cell from builder's content into a slice. Alias to `self.toCell().asSlice()`.

## Int.toString
```tact
extends fun toString(self: Int): String;
```
Converts Int value to String

## Int.toFloatString
```tact
extends fun toFloatString(self: Int, digits: Int): String
```

Converts Fixed Float value that represented as Int to String

Where,
* `self` significant part of float number as Int number;
* `digits` is a exponentiation parameter of expression `10^(-digits)` that will be used for computing float number. `digits` required to be `0 <= digits < 77`.

## Int.toCoinsString
```tact
extends fun toCoinsString(self: Int): String
```
Converts nanoToncoin Int value `self` to String float number of Toncoins and returns it as a result.

## String.asComment
```tact
extends fun asComment(self: String): Cell
```
Converts String `self` to comment message body Cell.

## String.asSlice
```tact
extends fun asSlice(self: String): Slice;
```
**Dangerously** casts string as slice for future parsing. Use it only if you know what you are doing.

## Slice.asString
```tact
extends fun asString(self: Slice): String;
```
**Dangerously** casts slice as string. Use it only if you know what you are doing.

## String.fromBase64
```tact
extends fun fromBase64(self: String): Slice;
```
Decodes base64 string to a slice. NOTE: This method is very limited and can be used only for small strings that fits a single cell.

## Slice.fromBase64
```tact
extends fun fromBase64(self: Slice): Slice;
```
Decodes base64 slice to a slice. Alias for `self.asString().fromBase64()`
