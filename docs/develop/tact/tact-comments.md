# Comments

# Comments
Tact has single-line comments which start with `//`. For example:
```java
x: Int as int32 = 1; // assign 1 to x
```

It also has multi-line comments which start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Note that unlike in many other languages, FunC multi-line comments can be nested. For example:
```java
 /* This is a multi-line comment
    this is 2nd line in the multi-line comment
 */
```
