Right now there is 2 great approaches how to start developing TON smart contracts:

* [Scaleton](http://scaleton.io) — see your custom token balances.

## Standard smart contracts

:::caution advanced level
This information is **very low level** and could be hard to understand for newcomers.  
So feel free to read about it later.
:::

If you're already familiar with smart contracts, you could try to read the following examples:
- [Fungible (Jettons), Non-Fungible (NFT), Semi-Fungible Tokens Smart Contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/tree/main)
- [Standard Smart Contracts Examples](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/smartcont)
- [Wallet V4 Smart Contract Example](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract)

:::info little tip
Feel free to focus on smart contracts written using _FunC_  (***.fc**) instead of low-level *Fift* (***.fif**) language. It would be easier experience.
