## What is TON?

The _The Open Network (TON)_ is a fast, secure and scalable blockchain and
network project, focused on handling _millions of transactions per second_ if
necessary, and both user-friendly and service provider-friendly platform. 

One might think about TON as a huge distributed supercomputer,
or rather a huge "_superserver_", intended to host and provide a variety of
services.

```

The idea of TON consists of many services around decentralized consensus:

* TON DNS
* TON Sites
* TON Payments
* TON Storage
* TON Proxy

:::note
You always can read more when these services are implemented in [TON Roadmap](https://ton.org/roadmap).
