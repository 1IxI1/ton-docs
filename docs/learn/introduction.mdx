# The Open Network

__The Open Network (TON)__ is a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain focused on handling _millions of transactions per second_ with one goal: to reach the first billion blockchain users.

You can imagine TON as a huge distributed supercomputer,
or a "_superserver_", intended to host and provide a variety of services to build decentralized internet of the future.

* Discover which services TON provides: [Participate in TON](/participate/)
* Dive deep to the technical aspects: [Blockchain of Blockchains](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain)
