# Single Nominator Pool

Currently [mytonctrl](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl) have no native support to `single_nominator` contract, so here steps how to setup it.

:::info
Native support will be released in Q4 2023
:::

## Prepare the Validator

#### Prepare launched Validator

  If you have mytonctrl installed and validator running:

  1. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.

#### Prepare from the beginning
  If you had no Validator before, do the following:
   1. [Run a Validator](/participate/run-nodes/full-node) and make sure it's synced.
   2. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.


## Prepare single_nominator


1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) v.16 and later and npm  ([detailed instructions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions))
2. Install `ts-node` and `arg` module

```bash
$ sudo apt install ts-node
$ sudo npm i arg -g
```


4. Create symlinks:

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/fift /usr/local/bin/fift
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/func /usr/local/bin/func
```

5. Run test to make sure everything is set up properly:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

6. Replace mytonctrl nominator-pool scripts: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orbs-network/single-nominator/main/mytonctrl-scripts/install-pool-scripts.sh



## Create single_nominator Pool

1. Get Toncenter API key from a Telegram [@tonapibot](https://t.me/tonapibot)
2. Set env variables:

```bash
export OWNER_ADDRESS=<owner_address>
export VALIDATOR_ADDRESS=<validator_wallet_address>
export TON_ENDPOINT=https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC
export TON_API_KEY=<toncenter api key>
```

2. Create deployer address:

```bash
$ npm run init-deploy-wallet
Insufficient Deployer [EQAo5U...yGgbvR] funds 0
```

3. Topup deployer address with 2.1 TON
4. Deploy pool contract, you will get pool address: `Ef-kC0..._WLqgs`:

```
$ npm run deploy
```

5. Convert address to .addr:

```
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/str-to-addr.fif Ef-kC0..._WLqgs
```

(Saving address to file single-nominator.addr)

6. Backup deployer private key "./build/deploy.config.json" and "single-nominator.addr" files
7. Copy "single-nominator.addr" to "mytoncore/pools/single-nominator-1.addr"
8. Send stake from owner address to single nominator address

## Withdrawals from Single Nominator

Using wallets to withdraw from single_nominator
Fift:

1. Create "withdraw.boc" request with amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Create and sign request from owner's wallet:

```bash
$ fift -s wallet-v3.fif <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <sub_wallet_id> <seqno> <amount=1> -B withdraw.boc
```

3. Broadcast query:

```bash
$ lite-client -C global.config.json -c 'sendfile wallet-query.boc'
tons
```

1. Create "withdraw.boc" request with amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Send request to single nominator address:

```bash
$ tons wallet transfer <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <amount=1> --body withdraw.boc
tonkeeper
```

a.
```
npm link typescript
```

b.
```
npx ts-node scripts/ts/withdraw-deeplink.ts <single-nominator-addr> <withdraw-amount>
```

c. Open deeplink on the owner's phone
