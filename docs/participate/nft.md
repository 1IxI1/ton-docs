# NFT Use Cases

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of digital asset that is unique and cannot be replaced by another identical asset. This article describes approaches and already implemented use cases of NFTs in TON Blockchain.

After reading this article, you will understand why NFTs are helpful and even could implement one of the approaches you love in your service.

## Item ownership

Non-fungible tokens are mostly known as cool pictures that you buy and sell on the NFT Marketplace like OpenSea or [getgems.io](https://getgems.io).

NFT pictures and collections are funny and educative for the understanding concept of ownership backed by blockchain. However, in the long-term, focus on NFT utility plays a crucial role to add value to the idea of ownership.

## Support your Artist

One of the first ideas behind the NFTs was to support artists by buying their works packed as collections of NFTs stored in the Blockchain.

In this way, artists make money from selling new works they made and also from royalties after reselling the NFT by someone else on the market.

It's the most common reason marketplaces like [getgems.io](https://getgems.io/) or OpenSea is the essential infrastructure for any blockchain nowadays.

## Account as a NFT

In November, Telegram team released [Fragment](https://fragment.com/) marketplace where anyone can buy and own short Telegram username backed by NFT standard in TON Blockchain. 

Moreover, in December Telegram team released [No-SIM sign-up](https://telegram.org/blog/ultimate-privacy-topics-2-0#sign-up-without-a-sim-card). You can buy a **virtual phone number** as a NFT to sign up in Telegram Messenger and ensure that your privacy is secured by TON Blockchain.

## Domain as a NFT

TON DNS service works fully on-chain. If you want to own domain in decentralized web backed by TON like `mystore.ton` you need to buy the NFT domain on [DNS marketplace](https://dns.ton.org/) to your wallet and pay renting fee for storing and processing data in the blockchain.

### NFT as address for your Wallet

Everyone in crypto knows the idea of unique addresses of wallets like `Egbt...Ybgx`. But if you want to receive money from your mom, it's a useless approach to blockchain mass adoption!

That's why a wallet backed by the domain `billy.ton` would work better for users outside of crypto.

[Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) wallet already implemented this approach. You can check it now.
