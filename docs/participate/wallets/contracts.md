# Types of Wallet Contracts

Probably you have heard somewhere about different versions of wallets in the TON blockchain. But what do these versions really mean and how do they differ?

In this article, we we'll look at all versions and modifications of the TON wallets.

## How can wallets be different?

Before we start, we need to understand why wallets can differ at all.

If we look at Ethereum, Solana or almost any other blockchain, there are no different types or versions of wallets. But why TON has them? That's because wallets in TON are made by smart contracts. Basically, any wallet (even yours) is a smart contract running on TON blockchain which can accept and send transactions to other wallets which are also smart contracts.

These smart contracts can be done in different ways and can have different features. That's why there are several versions of wallets in TON.

## Basic wallets

### Wallet V1

This is the simplest one. It only allows you to send one transaction at the time, and it doesn't check anything but your signature and seqno.

This version isn't even used in regular apps because it has some major issues:
 - No easy way to retreive seqno and public key from the contract
 - No valid_until check so you can't be sure that transaction won't be confirmed too late.

The first issue is fixed in V1R2 and V1R3. That `R` letter means `revision`. Usually revisions are just small updates which only add get-methods which allows you to retreive seqno and public key from the contract.
But this version still has the second issue, which is fixed in the next version.

### Wallet V2

This version introduces `valid_until` parameter which is used to set the time limit for transaction in case you don't need it to be confirmed too late. This version also don't have the get-method for public key, which is added in V2R2.

This version can be used in most cases, but it misses one cool improvement which is done in V3.

### Wallet V3

This version introduces `subwallet_id` parameter which allows you to create multiple wallets using the same public key (so you can have only one seedphrase and lots of wallets). And as before, V3R2 only adds the get-method for public key.

Basically, `subwallet_id` is just a number which is added to the contract state on deploy. And since contract address in TON is a hash of its state and code, wallet address will change with different `subwallet_id`.

This version is the most used right now. It covers most of the use-cases and it still remains clean and simple.

### Wallet V4

It is the most modern wallet version at this moment. It still has all the functionality of previous versions, but also introduces something very powerful â€” `plugins`.

This feature allows developers to implement complex logic that will work with user's wallet. For example, some DApp may require user to pay a little amount of coins every day to use some features, so user will need to install the plugin on their wallet by signing a transaction. This plugin will send coins to destanation address every day when it'll be called by external message.

This is very customizable feature which is unique to TON blockchain.

## Special wallets

Sometimes functionality of basic wallets isn't enough. That's why there are several types of specialized wallets: `high-load`, `lockup` and `restricted`.

Let's have a look at them.

### High-load wallet

This wallet is made for those who need to send hundreds of transactions in a short period of time. For example, crypto exchanges.

It allows you to send up-to 254 transactions at one smart contract call. It also uses a little different approach to solve replay attacks instead of seqno, so you can call this wallet several times at once to send even thousands of transactions in a second.

### Lockup wallet

If you, for some reason, need to lock the coins on a wallet for some time without possibility to withdraw them before that time passes, have a look at the lockup wallet.

It allows you to set the time, until which you won't be able to withdraw anything from the wallet. You can also customize it for a little, by setting unlock periods, so that you will be able to spend some amount of coins on every period.

For example: you can create a wallet which will hold 1 million coins with total vesting time of 10 years. Set the cliff duration to one year, so funds will be locked for the first year after wallet is created. And set the unlock period to one month, so 1'000'000 TON / 120 month = ~8333 TON will unlock every month.

### Restricted wallet

This wallet's function is to act like a regular wallet but restrict transfers to only one pre-defined destanation address. You can set the destanation when you create this wallet and then you'll be only able to transfer funds from it to that address. But note that you can still transfer funds to validation contracts so you can run a validator with this wallet.

## Conclusion

As you see, there are a lot of different versions of wallets in TON. But in most cases you only need V3R2 or V4R2. You can also use one of the special wallets if you want to have some additional functionality like periodic unlocks of funds.
