[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of *open-source projects*, their *maintainers*, and the entire community of *contributors*. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests.

For the TON community it's time to help ecosystem growth together, so let's join to the whole world with our **Hack-TON-berfest** party and become *#1 open-source ecosystem of the year*!

## How to Participate?

Rules of the Hacktoberfest event in 2022 are:

* **Hacktoberfest is open to everyone**!
* Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
* Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB project:
  * [List of projects on TON Ecosystem](/hacktonberfest)
  * [List of projects on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest)
* Have **4** pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31
* The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt. _(from Hacktoberfest community)_
* Every participant (maintainer and contributor) to any of TON Ecosystem projects will receive [**Limited Hack-TON-berfest NFT**](#what-the-rewards). _(from TON Foundation)_

For everyone in TON it's an opportunity to drive the whole ecosystem growth and receive cool rewards from TON Foundation. Let's do it together!

## What the rewards?

To motivate community contribute to open-source projects in TON Ecosystem, you'll be able to receive a special reward from TON Foundation. Every participant will receive a **Limited Hack-TON-berfest NFT** achievement as a proof of participating:
